## WarmUp
Review from Task Manager
  - What file extension did we use for HTML files?
  - What does that file extension stand for?
  - How did we create structure in our HTML?
  
### Hyper Text Markup Language

A Markup Language used for describing the structure/layout of web pages.

Some HTML tags are "containers" for content, and some tags **are** the content.

### Structure of an HTML Document

  - General Structure:

  ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title></title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Chonburi|Muli">
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="../stylesheets/main.css" />
        <script type="text/javascript" src="javascript.js"></script>
      </head>
      <body>

      </body>
    </html>
  ```
  - Let's talk about the specific parts:

#### [Type Declaration](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp)

  - `<!DOCTYPE html>` tells our browsers that our application is using HTML5.
  - `<html>` signals the beginning of our HTML.

#### Head

  - Contains all the meta data about the document.
  - The ones we care about right now are:
    - `<title>` - The title that will show in the tab of your browser.
    - `<link>` - How we link to external stylesheets, i.e. our CSS. We want this in the head so it loads first. We could also style right in our html document with a `style` tag but DON'T DO THAT.
    - `<script>` - How we link to our client-side statements (JavaScript).

#### Body

  - Contains ALL the elements of the HTML document that we would like to display.

### Semantic vs Non-Semantic Tags

  - How did you create HTML structure in your Task Manager app? Most everyone uses `<div>` tags at first.

#### Non-Semantic

  - `div`s - incredibly common but with the introduction of HTML5, there was a move towards semantic tags.
  - `div`s tell us NOTHING about the content of the element.  
  - A good use case for a `div` might be creating an element on a page like a solid box.

  ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Personal Site</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <div class="nav">
          <h1>Welcome to Ilana's Site</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="about-me">
          <div class="bio">
            <h2>Denver</h2>
            <p>Denver is where I live.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="education">
            <h2>Schooling</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>University of Colorado</li>
              <li>Turing School of Software and Design</li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="portfolio">
          <div class="apps">
            <a href="http://arcade.turing.io">Turing Arcade</a>
          </div>
          <div class="lesson-plans">
            <p>ALL OF THEM</p>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class="contact-me">
          <p>email me at <a href="mailto:ilana@turing.io"></a></p>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  ```

#### Semantic Tags

  - Can act the same as a `div` but have implied meaning.
  - Some examples of semantic tags:
    * `<article>`
    * `<aside>`
    * `<details>`
    * `<figcaption>`
    * `<figure>`
    * `<footer>`
    * `<header>`
    * `<main>`
    * `<mark>`
    * `<nav>`
    * `<section>`
    * `<summary>`
    * `<time>`
    * See more information about the specific tags [here](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp)

  Example:   

  ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8">
        <title>Personal Site</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <nav>
          <h1>Welcome to Ilana's Site</h1>
        </nav>
        <section class="about-me">
          <header>
            <p>I would like to tell you about myself</p>
          </header>
          <article class="bio">
            <h2>Denver</h2>
            <p>Denver is where I live.</p>
          </article>
          <article class="education">
            <h2>Schooling</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>University of Colorado</li>
              <li>Turing School of Software and Design</li>
            </ul>
          </article>
        </section>
        <section class="portfolio">
          <header>
            <p>Here is my work:</p>
          </header>
          <article class="apps">
            <a href="http://arcade.turing.io">Turing Arcade</a>
          </article>
          <article class="lesson-plans">
            <p>ALL OF THEM</p>
          </article>
        </section>
        <footer class="contact-me">
          <p>email me at <a href="mailto:ilana@turing.io"></a></p>
        </footer>
      </body>
    </html>
  ```
  - A lot of the tags we use are already semantic such as form, link, etc.

### Display Properties: Block vs. Inline
  - The default value for all HTML tags is `inline`. Most "User Agent stylesheets" (the default styles the browser applies) reset many elements to `block`
  - The display value can be changed with the CSS property `display`.

#### Block
  - An element with a display of block will take up the entire width of the page, no matter how small the content is within the tag. 
  - It will always start on a new line.
  - `p`, `form`, `h1 - h6`, `ul`, `section` and `div`s are all block elements

#### Inline
  - `link`, `a`, `span` are all inline by default.
  - They will only take up as much space as it needs.
  - It will not start on a new line.
  - You can set the margin and padding but it will only adjust horizontally. Will ignore any rules for width or height.

#### Inline-Block
  - Will situate itself inline, but can set a width and height.

### HTML Tag Attributes - The Break Down

#### Example 1

  - `<section class="tasks" id="all-tasks">`
    - `class` - used for several elements.
    - `id` - used for one element. Takes higher priority in CSS (more on this later).

#### Example 2

  - `<input name="task[title]" value="Enter Task Here">`
    - Seen in our forms.
    - Seen mostly in `input` or `button`.
    - `name` - the key the data submitted will have.
    - `task[title]` - the nested parameter value that maps to the key `name`. Typically entered by the user. More on this nested parameter in our "Passing Data" lesson.
    - `value` - the value we want the `input` or `button` to have when the page is rendered.

### Recap

  - What type of information belongs in the head of an HTML document?
  - Why would we use semantic vs. non-semantic tags?
  - What is the difference between a block and inline element?
  - When should we use an `id` over a `class`?
  - How do we use `name` and `value`?
