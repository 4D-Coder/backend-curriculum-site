# Nested Resources

## Learning Goals

- How do you use nested resources in Rails?
- When should you use Nested Resources?

## Warm Up

Create a table containing all of the HTTP verbs, URI patterns, and controller actions that Rails gives you when you have the following:

```ruby
# config/routes.rb

resources :muffins
```

## Background

Read [this](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html#nested-resources) section of the Rails routing documentation and discuss with the person next to you.

## Examples

```
GET  /artists/1/songs
GET  /artists/1/songs/new
POST /artists/1/songs
```

## How do we Create Nested Routes?

Indentation and a do/end marker!

```
# config/routes.rb
resources :artists do
  resources :songs
end
```

* Run `rake routes`

## Shallow Nesting

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :artists, shallow: true do
  resources :songs
end
```

* Run `rake routes` again.
* How does this differ from what was generated without `shallow: true`?
* When we would we want it one way or the other?

## `form_for` with an un-nested resource

`form_for` uses an object passed to it as an argument to determine:

* Whether to render a new form or an update form
* Whether the fields in the form correspond to attributes on the object
* What route to use when sending the information when a user hits submit

## `form_for` with Nested Resources

* Need to pass **BOTH** the initial resource as well as the nested resource (eg, both `artists` and `songs`)
* Will provide them in an array as an argument
  * the array HAS to be in the correct order!
* Need to update both our controller and our view

## Let's code along:

- You should have a test already to see the form for a new song.
- Now let's create a new song with an artist.

Based on what we know about nested routes, let's start here:

```ruby
  #spec/features/user_can_create_a_new_song_spec.rb
  artist = Artist.create(name: "Journey")
  visit "/artists/#{artist.id}/songs/new"
  title = "Don't Stop Believin'"
  length = 231
  
  fill_in :song_title, with: title
  fill_in :song_length, with: length

  click_on "Create Song"

  expect(current_path).to eq("/songs/#{Song.last.id}")
  expect(page).to have_content(title)
  expect(page).to have_content(length)
  expect(page).to have_content(artist.name)
```

- What is in your controller? What is in your view?
- We previously wrote a test to see a new form for a new song but did not actually create a new song.

- Our controller should only have an empty `new` method:

```ruby
#app/controllers/songs_controller.rb
def new
end
```

- And our view like this:

```html
<form action="/songs" method="post">
  <input type="text" name="song[title]" value="Title">
  <input type="number" name="song[length]" value="Length">
  <input type="submit" value="Create Song">
</form>
```

- This should take us all the way to a failing test:

```bash
Failure/Error: click_on "Create Song"

     ActionController::RoutingError:
       No route matches [POST] "/songs"
```

Hmmmm, but we have opened the routes for making a new song for an artist.

Let's check out `rake routes` output to see what route we are actually trying to hit. 

* What are we looking for? A route that creates our new song.
* Which HTTP verb do we use when we create a new resource?

```bash
  POST   /artists/:artist_id/songs(.:format)     songs#create
```

- Based on the route above, we need our form to post to a route for a specific artist's songs.
- How can we do that? Through the controller and form! Let's make those adjustments.

```ruby
# app/controllers/songs_controller.rb
def new
  @artist = Artist.find(params[:artist_id])
  @song   = Song.new
end
```

- Lets update our view to use `@song` as a parameter to a form helper:

```
# app/views/songs/new.html.erb
<h1>Create a New Song</h1>

<%= form_for [@artist, @song] do |f| %>
  <%= f.label :title %>
  <%= f.text_field :title %>
  <%= f.label :length %>
  <%= f.number_field :length %>
  <%= f.label :play_count %>
  <%= f.number_field :play_count %>
  <%= f.submit %>
<% end %>
```

Let's run RSpec and adjust our `SongsController` so we can point the form to its `create` method:

```ruby
# app/controllers/songs_controller.rb

def create
  artist = Artist.find(params[:artist_id])
  song = artist.songs.create(song_params)
  redirect_to "/songs/#{song.id}"
end
```

- LAST: Adjust your song show page view to show the artist of the song!
- We should have a passing test!!!

Creating a New Song via localhost

* Be sure you have at least one artist in your database
* Run `rails s`
* Visit `/artists/1/songs/new`

---

# Mixing Nested and Non-Nested Routes

* What if we want to see a list of all songs?

```ruby
# config/routes.rb
resources :artists, shallow: true do
  resources :songs
end

resources :songs, only: [:index]
```

Visit `/songs` and you should see all songs.

# Checks for Understanding

Turn and talk to your neighbor and discuss:

* When would you use a nested resource?
* How do you nest a resource in your routes file?
* How does that change your routes?
* What does it mean to use shallow nesting? Why would you do this?
* What changes do you need to make in your controller when you nest a resource?
