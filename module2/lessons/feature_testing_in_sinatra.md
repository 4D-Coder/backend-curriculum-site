## Learning Goals

* differentiate between feature tests and model tests
* write user stories
* translate user stories into feature tests using Capybara

## Vocabulary
* feature test
* user story
* DSL (Domain Specific Language)

## Repository

You should be able to use the Film File repository that we have been using this week. If you have not yet cloned it down, you can find it [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/set-list).

## Warmup

* What are we testing so far in our SetList app?
* What aren't we testing?
* Assuming that our tests will have some setup, execution, assertions, and teardown, what might be included in each phase?

## Lecture

## What are Feature Tests?

* Feature tests mimic the behavior of the user: In the case of web apps, this behavior will be clicking, filling in forms, visiting new pages, etc.
* Just like a user, the feature test should not need to know about underlying code
* Based on user stories

## What are User Stories?

* A tool used to communicate user needs to software developers.
* They are used in Agile Development, and it was first introduced in 1998 by proponents of Extreme Programming.
* They describe what a user needs to do in order to fulfill a function.

```txt
As a user
When I visit the home page
And I fill in title
And I fill in description
And I click submit
Then my task is saved
```


We can generalize this pattern as follows:

```
As a [user/user-type]
When I [action]
And I [action]
And I [action]
...
Then [expected result]
```

Depending on how encompassing a user story is, you may want to make multiple Waffle cards from a single story.

### Exercise: Create User Stories

Open a blank file and write user stories for the four situations below with a partner:

* Adding a Horse to HorsesApp
* Signing up for a new account
* Logging into an account
* Viewing only the Horses associated with a specific Jockey

## Creating Our Feature Test

[Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara#using-capybara-with-rspec)

Capybara is a Ruby test framework that allows you to feature test any RACK-based app.

It provides a DSL (domain specific language) to help you query and interact with the DOM.

For example, the following methods are included in the Capybara DSL:

* `visit(path)`
* `expect(page).to have_content("Content")`
* `within("CSS") { Assertions here }`
* `fill_in("identifier", with: "Content")`
* `click_link("identifier")`
* `click_button("identifier")`
* `click_on("identifier")`
* `expect(current_path).to eq('/')`

### Important Setup Things

Ensure the following lines are present in your `Gemfile` in the `:development, :test` group:

```ruby
gem 'capybara'
gem 'launchy'
```

Run `bundle`

Update your `spec/spec_helper.rb` file to include the following:

```ruby
# other required items here
require 'capybara/dsl'

Capybara.app = SetList
Capybara.save_path = 'tmp/capybara'

# within the RSpec configuration (this is the same place you have your database cleaner options set):

  c.include Capybara::DSL
```
NOTE: If you do not have a spec/spec_helper.rb follow the set up directions found [here](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module2/lessons/model_testing_in_sinatra.md)

### Writing the Test

Since we're going to be creating a new type of test, let's add a new folder to separate them from our model tests. The test that we're about to create is probably *not* a test you'd actually write in your project, but it's a simple example to show how Capybara works.

```bash
$ mkdir spec/features/
$ touch spec/features/user_sees_welcome_spec.rb
```

In that new file add the following:

```ruby
RSpec.describe "an unauthenticated user visits welcome page" do
  it "they see a welcome message" do
    # Your code here.
  end
end
```

Now, our user story is something along the lines of the following:

* As an unauthenticated user
* When I visit the root page
* I should see a welcome message

Let's turn that user story into a test using the Capybara methods from above and make it pass.

```ruby
RSpec.describe "an unauthenticated user visits welcome page" do
  context "they visit /" do
    scenario "they see a welcome message" do
      visit '/'

      within("#greeting") do
        expect(page).to have_content("Welcome!")
      end
    end
  end
end
```

### What about all of those html files from save_and_open_page?

If you used `save_and_open_page` in your test as you were trying to determine what should be included in your view, Launchy will have generated a number of files and saved them. They should be living in your `tmp/capybara` directory since you used this line in your spec_helper: `Capybara.save_path = 'tmp/capybara'`

However, they will still be watched by git unless you make a `.gitignore` file at the root of your project:

```bash
$ touch .gitignore
```

Then, inside that file, add:

```
/tmp
```

This will tell git to ignore everything inside of the `tmp` directory.

## Workshop

Write a test for:

* The process of creating a song
* That all songs are displayed on the song index
* That a playlists total song lengths are displayed on their page

## Wrap Up
* What is the difference between a model and feature test?
* What are the 4 main methods (blocks) for a test? Why/when would you use each one?
* What is the general structure of a user story?
