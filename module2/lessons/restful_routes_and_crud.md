title: RESTful Routes and CRUD
---

## Learning Goals

* Explain CRUD in the context of web applications.
* Explain what is REST
* Create a routes reference chart for the seven RESTful routes.
* Be able to distinguish between a RESTful vs non-RESTful route.

## Vocabulary
* CRUD
* REST
* HTTP Verbs
* URI

## Warmup

Based on your intermission work:

* What does CRUD stand for?
* Look at your Task Manager routes: what are the eight different method/path/controller#action combinations contained there?
* What does each one do?

## CRUD

* C - Create
* R - Read
* U - Update
* D - Delete

This is a list of the operations we can perform on a _resource_.

In this context, _resource_ is a generic term for something that we have in our application (e.g. tasks, people, movies). Generally, each table we create in our database holds specific instances of a particular resource. We create, read, update and destroy resources in our database.

Often, our applications will have a separate controller and model for each resource.

## REST

* **Representational State Transfer** (ReST) is a web architecture style
* Coined by Roy Fielding in doctoral dissertation (2000)
* REST is a simple way to organize interactions between independent systems
* A map between HTTP verb/path combinations and CRUD actions users want to perform on a resource
* RESTful applications typically treat the web like a resource

### HTTP Verbs

* GET: retrieve a resource from a url
* POST: create a new resource
* PUT: update an entire resource
* PATCH: update part of a resource
* DELETE: remove/destroy a resource

Additional information from the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec9.html).

### URI

* **Uniform Resource Identifier**

In this context, the portion of the URL after the domain.

For the URL `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier`, the URI would be `/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier`.

**Turn & Talk**

What is the URI for this address? `http://www.tatteredcover.com/book/9781626722934` 

### Seven RESTful Routes

Pull up the routes and TaskController from Task Manager. Let's see if we can create a [table](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1AGjUE49UJajPEQHvh3plKjaem5RAGvuv5SNjZzvjD9U/edit?usp=sharing) for seven RESTful routes allowing us to perform all CRUD actions on a Task. Include the following:

* What a user wants
* Method (verb)
* URI
* Data Prep/Manipulation
* Do we want to Redirect or Render erb
* Name of View

In small groups complete the table either on a computer or poster.

|What does it do?|Verb|URI|Data Prep| Redirect or Render?|View|

### Not So RESTful routes

* Do research. What is an example of a non-RESTful route?
  * `/tasks/add`
  
  
## WrapUp 
* What is each part of CRUD? 
* What is REST? 
* How do we combine CRUD and REST in web applications?
* Record a version of the restful routes table in your notes
