    <h2 id="before">Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome to Turing! Your pre-work is broken up into a few different sections. Start off with the first week's suggested schedule. Once you've completed everything in the first week's schedule, move on to the Next Steps. If you still have time and would like to learn more, you may move on to the Extend Your Learning section. Before coming to Turing, please remember to complete Task G, the Pre-Work Reflection.

    <h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Prework helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their early weeks with us.

    <h3>Your Time at Turing</h3>
    <p>
      If you haven't heard already, Turing is a fast-paced learning environment. Our goal is to prepare you to be a successful, employable web developer by the end of your 4th module. Being as fast paced as it is, the prework is essential to prepare you for your learning at Turing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turing isn't just about learning to code. We want to prepare you technically and in professional skills, which includes supporting Turing's mission and vision:
    </p>
    <blockquote cite="https://www.turing.io/">
      Our mission is to unlock human potential by training a diverse, inclusive student body to succeed in high-fulfillment technical careers. Our vision is a world powered by technology where the people building it represent the people using it. We're here to build a movement.
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      For more information about Turing activities and policies, you can read the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1mpYj9P8HAVDsxETDH-j6AYyvMSXRzen6WWLFiXN-6BQ/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Turing Student Handbook</a> and see the <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9aTlCQk2zN4bllkY1RWQkJtRjA/view" target="_blank">Course Catalog</a>.

    <h3>What is Back-End Development?</h3>
    <p>
      Modern software, and web software especially, is driven by content – without the content, most of it wouldn’t be worth bothering with. And all of that content has to live somewhere. It needs to be stored, retrieved, manipulated, formatted, etc. etc. When we talk about “back-end” programming, we’re often thinking of the programming tasks involved in making this possible:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Storing data and accessing it later</li>
      <li>Verifying that data is accurate</li>
      <li>Manipulating and analyzing data</li>
      <li>Making sure data can be retrieved quickly and easily</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The “front-end” is the part of the application that users see, touch, and interact with. The “back-end” typically handles stuff like storing information in databases, manipulating that data, authenticating users, etc.; it’s what happens behind the scenes.
    </p>

    <h3 id="learning_goals">Learning Goals</h3>
    <p>
      The prework below is intended to take you 7 days. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day.  If you plan to spend more than 7 days working on the prework, you should break up the work so that you are coding every day!
    </p>
    <p>
      At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of prework is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.
    </p>
    <p>
      After completing the prework, you should be able to do the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)</li>
      <li>Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple program (for show and tell)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If you have more than 7 days (or more than 30 hours) to dedicate to prework, first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue on to the <strong>Next Steps</strong> section that contains additional resources on multiple subjects to use as a deeper dive.</p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h3>What You'll Need</h3>
    <p>Here are the items you will need to complete the prework:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A computer - preferably a laptop running Mac OSX that is a 2013 model or newer</li>
    </ul>

  <h2>Prework Assignments</h2>
  <p>
    As you begin working on the assignments below, please keep in mind the following due dates: the <strong>Daily Ruby Practice</strong> activities are due <strong>no later than</strong> the Friday before the module starts, and the <strong>Ongoing</strong> activities are due <strong>no later than</strong> the first day of the Module, at 9AM.
  </p>

          <p>
            Aim for 25 wpm without looking at the keyboard. Focus on Ruby. You would be surprised how many common programming keyboard characters you're not used to typing. Plan to spend about 15-20 minutes per day on this.
          </p>

        </li>
      </ul>

      <ul class="expander-content" hidden>
      <p>
        We have set up a repository on GitHub from where you will complete your 7 days of prework Ruby Practice.  You can think of a repository as a master directory (or folder) that holds an entire program or project.  In this case, the repository will hold your prework!
      </p>
      <p>
        Before completing any of the other activities, you will need to complete the Environment Setup as described in the Day 0 folder of the repository.  You can find the Environment Setup Steps <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/backend_prework/tree/master/day_0">HERE</a>.  After completing the Environment Setup, return to this Prework page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In programming, most repositorys have a README that explains how to use the repository and this one is no different.  Navigate to the <a href="https://github.com/turingschool-examples/backend_prework">Prework Repository</a> and, starting with <strong>Day 1</strong>, complete the activities described in the README.

      <ul class="expander-content" hidden>
        <p>
          The assignments below will be submitted in gists that you will create on your GitHub account. Once you have completed the GitHub setup described on Day 0 of the Ruby Practice repository (see above).  You will be able to create your own gists.  A gists is just a text document that can be stored on GitHub.  To create a gist, follow the steps below:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Log in to your GitHub account</li>
          <li>In the upper right corner, click on the '+' icon</li>
          <li>Select 'New Gist'</li>
          <li>Enter a filename, with the extension .md</li>
          <li>Enter the text of your gist in the large text area</li>
          <li>click Create Public Gist</li>

          <h4>Turing Professional Development Pre-Work</h4>
          <p>
            During your time at Turing, you will participate in our professional development sessions. This is an important part of our curriculum. As a precursor to the work you will do at Turing, complete the exercises listed <a href="https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/prework/pd_prework.md">here</a> by <strong>no later</strong> than the Monday before the module starts, 9am.

          <h4>Gear-Up</h4>
          <p>
            Turing is not just a school where you learn to code. In order to achieve our mission and vision, we have group sessions each week called Gear Up in order to bring community awareness to certain issues in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>
            Follow the instructions <a href = "https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/prework/gear_up_prework.md">here</a>.
            Read and write reflections on two of the articles within throughout the week. Anticipate spending approximately 30 - 45 minutes per article on this task.

        <h4><a href="https://evernote.com/" target="_blank">Evernote</a></h4>
        <p>
          Evernote is availble online or in the App Store that is a helpful tool for organizing notes and note taking.
          It's nice for adding code snippets, images, or links within your notes.
        </p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.spectacleapp.com/" target="_blank">Spectacle</a></h4>
        <p>
          While programming you will likely have multiple windows open.
          This tool helps you quickly manage window control.
