## Welcome!

Welcome to Turing! In order to make you as successful as possible during your time here, we have collected readings and exercises for you to complete prior to beginning Mod 1. This prework helps provide important context, vocabulary, and baseline of skills to help you hit the ground running on the first day of class. We've found that students who come into the program having invested time in familiarizing themselves with key concepts are able to maximize their time at Turing.

## Prework Overview

The prework below is intended to take 8 days, with the first day dedicated to computer setup. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day. If you plan to spend more than 7 days working on the prework, you should break up the work so that you are coding every day!

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This 7 days of prework is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.

After completing the prework, you should be able to do the following:

* Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
* Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple program

If you have more than 7 days (or more than 30 hours) to dedicate to prework, first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue on to the Next Steps section that contains additional resources on multiple subjects to use as a deeper dive.

## Prework Assignments

The following assignments are due **the Friday before your first day of class**.

### Professional Development

Turing is not just a school where you learn to code. Turing's curriculum focuses on both technical and professional development. In order to achieve our mission and vision, we also have group sessions each week called Gear Up in order to bring community awareness to certain issues in the tech industry.

The assignments below will be submitted in gists that you will create on your GitHub account. You will create this account once you have completed the GitHub setup described on Day 0 of the technical prework repository (see below). You will be able to create your own gists. A gist is just a text document that can be stored on GitHub. To create a gist, follow the steps below:

* Log in to your GitHub account
* In the upper right corner, click on the '+' icon
* Select 'New Gist'
* Enter a filename, with the extension .md
* Enter the text of your gist in the large text area
* click Create Public Gist
* You can also visit [This Link](https://gist.github.com/)

### Technical Prework

The technical prework can be completed in 8 days, with one day for setup. However, it is highly recommended that you begin the prework immediately. It is expected that you spend a few hours of concentrated effort on the tasks for each day - about 30 hours total. This should help you to establish a routine of coding every day. If you have more than 7 days working on the prework, you should break up the work and complete the Next Steps section below so that you are coding every day!

At Turing, you will have to code every single day to stay on top of the workload and build muscle memory for everything you've learned. This prework is designed to get you into that essential routine before day one of class.

After completing the prework, you should be able to do the following:

* Be comfortable navigating your development environment and using your tools (Atom, Chrome, the console, and the command line)
* Develop a basic knowledge of Ruby in order to build a simple program (for show and tell)

If you have more than 7 days (or more than 30 hours) to dedicate to prework, first complete the 7-day prework tasks, and then continue on to the Next Steps section that contains additional resources on multiple subjects to use as a deeper dive

### Next Steps

Before moving any further, complete all of the projects listed in Day 7 of the Backend Prework Repository. If you have more time, get ahead of the curve by working through the following activities. They are listed in order of priority.

1. Complete the [Railsbridge Curriculum](http://curriculum.railsbridge.org/ruby/)
1. Follow [This Lesson](http://backend.turing.io/module1/lessons/git_and_github) to learn more about Git and Github. Create some repositories to practice these commands. This will describe the workflow you will need throughout your time at Turing.
1. Dive deeper into Ruby with [Launch School's Ruby Book](https://launchschool.com/books/ruby)
1. [Become a command line master by working through](https://www.learnenough.com/command-line-tutorial)
