Open your terminal and run the following commands:

```
$ cd ~/turing/prework
$ mkdir day_1
$ touch day_1/questions.md
$ atom ./
```

Atom should then open showing all the files and subdirectories that you have in your `prework` directory.

Now, in Atom hit `command-t`, holding down both at the same time. This will open up a text box that will allow you to search your project directory for files. Try it now: begin typing `questions.md` and you should see a list of files appear below the text box (in this case your list might only be one item long). Be sure that the file `day_1/questions.md` is highlighted and hit return.

This will open the file in Atom and allow you to start typing. Copy and paste the questions below into that file and then add your answers.

1. In your own words, what's the difference between floats and integers?

1. What key-sequence can you use to stop a program if you accidentally create an infinite loop?

1. Using the `age` variable that you created above, how could you increase it's value by 1?

1. What method do you use to print information to the terminal?

1. Use Google to find the Ruby Docs for integers associated with Ruby version 2.4.1. There should be a list of methods on the left hand side of the page. Scroll through the page or click on a few of the methods. List three methods that you find in the documentation below with a short description of what each method does.

1. Do the same for floats.
