## 1. Cover Letter

Complete a cover letter for a real position (no, you cannot make one up), tailored accordingly. The letter should be formatted professionally and look just as a good as one you would submit for a dream job.

**Submit: Link to job posting and upload letter.**

## 2. Reflection on Learning Experiences

Please take time to really think about your answers to the attached questions. These are potentially what you would be talking about at coffee meetings, meet-ups, interviews, etc. If you think about your answers now, you'll be much more comfortable answering them later. Also, at the end of Mod 4 we ask for a presentation and your answers can be a great place to start for that presentation.
Reflection questions](./reflections_on_learning.md) on your learning experience thus far here at Turing.

**Submit: Link to gist.**

## 3. Cross Pollination Project Idea

During Mod 4 you have the opportunity to collaborate with Frontend students to build out applications. Now is the opportunity to be thinking about what you would be interested in building and potentially the tech stack you'd like to use. As part of your intermission work form, there is a section to fill out with details about your project idea. Please be as detailed as possible and include the tech stack you are considering. You will have an opportunity to review the project ideas that have been submitted, as well as, add to this list later in the mod should you have another idea that interests you. We look forward to seeing your ideas!

**Submit: Link to gist with your idea and tech stack.**

## 4. _Eloquent JavaScript_ Written by Marijn Haverbeke

Let's take some time to get familiar with JavaScript as a language before we dive straight into writing code.
Read the following chapters, and after _each_ chapter write a summary in a gist of what you took from that chapter.
__Important__ It is okay if you do not completely understand all the ideas you just read. We will have time to go over these topics in class, but want you to be exposed to these concepts and start getting familiar with them now.

  1. [Values, Types, and Operators](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)
  2. [Program Structure](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html)
  3. [Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
  4. [Data Structures: Objects and Arrays](https://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)

**Submit: Link to your gist containing your 4 summaries.**

## 5. JavaScript Server-Side

While JavaScript was originally intended to be a client-side scripting language, it has since made its way server-side thanks to Node.js. We're now able to use the same language for browser-based interactions as well as server-side scripts.

Let's get introduced to JavaScript without a browser. Work through [this lesson](http://backend.turing.io/module4/lessons/javascript_without_a_browser). It will introduce you to Node.js and basic testing.

**Submit: Link to your repo.**

## High Level Concepts to Keep in Mind
  -   Methods are called Functions
  -   You should know the difference between `undefined` and `null`; JS does not have a `nil` like Ruby does
  -   `require`ing a file you've written does nothing if you didn't export from that file
  -   All `return`s are explicit in Javascript. If you don't use the word `return`, your return value will be `undefined`

Google is your friend and it is totally reasonable to type things like ".each in javascript" or "what is const in javascript".
