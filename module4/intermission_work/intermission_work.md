## Intermission Work

To prepare for Module 4, please complete & submit the following before __11:59pm Saturday__, the Saturday day before the inning begins. This will ensure that you have a full day off before starting the mod. The pre-work should take a __maximum__ of 20 hours. __If you feel that you are struggling to understand fundamental JavaScript concepts, please reach out to your instructors for support.__ This is meant to be an introduction to the topics we will begin covering in week 1. _It is perfectly okay if these topics still feel a bit fuzzy at the end of the week._

1903 - Submit all links [here](https://forms.gle/u2HenCk5vNFHLp5s8).

## 1. Cross Pollination Project Idea

During Mod 4 you have the opportunity to collaborate with Frontend students to build out applications. If you have a great idea you want to work on, there is a section in the intermission work form to include a gist with details about your project idea. Please be as detailed as possible and include the tech stack you are considering. Taking the time now to to think through your proposal can save you from trying to come up with one during week 3 of the mod. You will have an opportunity to review the project ideas that have been submitted, as well as, add to this list later in the mod should you have another idea that interests you. We look forward to seeing your ideas!

__Submit: Link to gist with your idea and tech stack.__

## 2. _Eloquent JavaScript_ Written by Marijn Haverbeke

You may already be familiar with this book from the Mod 3 pre-work, which is great! If you are feeling comfortable and would enjoy exploring a little further there is an outline of additional chapters below. __The additional chapters are NOT required.__ However, if you are not feeling comfortable, or just want to revisit these first chapters that is perfectly okay.
__Important:__ It is okay if you do not completely understand all the ideas you just read. We will have time to go over these topics in class, but want you to be exposed to these concepts and start getting familiar with them now.

For a deliverable, please create a gist and write a short summary of what you are taking away from the chapters you've read.

## 3. Server-Side JavaScript

While JavaScript was originally intended to be a client-side scripting language, it has since made its way server-side thanks to Node.js. We're now able to use the same language for browser-based interactions as well as server-side scripts.

Let's get introduced to JavaScript without a browser. Work through [this lesson](../lessons/server_side_javascript). It will introduce you to Node.js, Express, and Sequelize.

__Submit: Link to your repo.__

## 4. Gear Up Lightning Talk

Submit your talk topic with a brief description by __9:00 am Monday of week 1__.
Example Submission:  
  - TOPIC: Bias in Facial Recognition Software
  - DESCRIPTION:  An overview of how facial recognition software was created, how it is used today, and what needs to change in order to ensure positive outcomes

__Duplicate topics will not be accepted, so submit early in order to secure your choice!__

## 5. Cover Letter

Complete a cover letter for a real position (no, you cannot make one up), tailored accordingly. The letter should be formatted professionally and look just as a good as one you would submit for a dream job. Please use [this](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/cover_letter_checklist.md) as a guide

__No Submission: Will review during PD__

## High Level Concepts to Keep in Mind
  -   Methods are called Functions
  -   You should know the difference between `undefined` and `null`; JS does not have a `nil` like Ruby does
  -   `require`ing a file you've written does nothing if you didn't export from that file
  -   All `return`s are explicit in Javascript. If you don't use the word `return`, your return value will be `undefined`

Google is your friend and it is totally reasonable to type things like ".each in javascript" or "what is const in javascript".
