Now is the opportunity to be thinking about what you would be interested in building and potentially the tech stack you'd like to use. As part of your intermission work form, there is a section to fill out with details about your project idea. Please be as detailed as possible and include the tech stack you are considering. You will have an opportunity to review the project ideas that have been submitted, as well as, add to this list later in the mod should you have another idea that interests you. We look forward to seeing your ideas!

### Tips for JS success

Some biggies if you're coming from Ruby:

-   Methods are called Functions
-   You should know the difference between `undefined` and `null`; JS does not have a `nil` like Ruby does
-   `require`ing a file you've written does nothing if you didn't export from that file
-   All `return`s are explicit in Javascript. If you don't use the word `return`, your return value will be `undefined`

Google is your friend. It's totally reasonable to type things like ".each in javascript" or "what is const in javascript"
