## Intermission Work

To prepare for Module 4, please complete & submit the following before noon Sunday, the day before the inning begins. This will allow instructors time to review and provide feedback. The pre-work should take a **maximum** of 20 hours. **If you feel that you are struggling to understand fundamental JavaScript concepts, please reach out to your instructors for support.** This is meant to be an introduction to the topics we will begin covering in week 1. It is okay if these topics still feel a bit fuzzy at the end of the week.

1811 - Submit all links [here](https://goo.gl/forms/UpAhJDBWEwu3yR0Z2).

## 1. Cross Pollination Project Idea

During Mod 4 you have the opportunity to collaborate with Frontend students to build out applications. If you have a great idea you want to work on, there is a section in the intermission work form to include a gist with details about your project idea. Please be as detailed as possible and include the tech stack you are considering. Taking the time now to to think through your proposal can save you from trying to come up with one during week 3 of the mod. You will have an opportunity to review the project ideas that have been submitted, as well as, add to this list later in the mod should you have another idea that interests you. We look forward to seeing your ideas!

**Submit: Link to gist with your idea and tech stack.**

## 2. _Eloquent JavaScript_ Written by Marijn Haverbeke

Let's take some time to get familiar with JavaScript as a language before we dive straight into writing code.
Read the following chapters, and after _each_ chapter write a summary (3 paragraphs maximum) in a gist of what you took from that chapter.
__Important__ It is okay if you do not completely understand all the ideas you just read. We will have time to go over these topics in class, but want you to be exposed to these concepts and start getting familiar with them now.

  1. [Values, Types, and Operators](https://eloquentjavascript.net/01_values.html)
  2. [Program Structure](https://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html)
  3. [Functions](https://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
  4. [Data Structures: Objects and Arrays](https://eloquentjavascript.net/04_data.html)
  5. [The Secret Life of Objects](https://eloquentjavascript.net/06_object.html)

**Submit: Link to your gist containing your 4 summaries.**

## 3. JavaScript Server-Side

- Intro to Express Prep Work -

While JavaScript was originally intended to be a client-side scripting language, it has since made its way server-side thanks to Node.js. We're now able to use the same language for browser-based interactions as well as server-side scripts.

Let's get introduced to JavaScript without a browser. Work through [this lesson](../lessons/javascript_without_a_browser). It will introduce you to Node.js and basic testing.

**Submit: Link to your repo.**

## 4. Apply for Yummly API key

For our paired project, we will be using the Yummly API. Please apply for your API key now, so if there are any issues getting one we can address them sooner rather than later. Sign up for the Academic plan [here](https://developer.yummly.com/#plans).

**No Submission**

## 5. Gear Up Lightening Talk

Submit your talk topic with a brief description [here](https://turingtalks.herokuapp.com/projects/new) by **9:00 am Monday of week 1**.
Example Submission:  
  - TOPIC: Bias in Facial Recognition Software
  - DESCRIPTION:  An overview of how facial recognition software was created, how it is used today, and what needs to change in order to ensure positive outcomes

**Duplicate topics will not be accepted, so submit early in order to secure your choice!**


## High Level Concepts to Keep in Mind
  -   Methods are called Functions
  -   You should know the difference between `undefined` and `null`; JS does not have a `nil` like Ruby does
  -   `require`ing a file you've written does nothing if you didn't export from that file
  -   All `return`s are explicit in Javascript. If you don't use the word `return`, your return value will be `undefined`

Google is your friend and it is totally reasonable to type things like ".each in javascript" or "what is const in javascript".
