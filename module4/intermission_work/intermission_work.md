## Required Work

To prepare for Module 4, please complete & submit the following before 12 noon Monday, the day before the inning begins. This will allow instructors time to review and provide feedback.

1808 - Submit all links [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfkVqfbTiCuZ71O-aFa24G4bwAhVDw69dcUB29PIN4vF5ZWxw/viewform).

## 1. Cover Letter

Complete a cover letter for a real position (no, you cannot make one up), tailored accordingly. The letter should be formatted professionally and look just as a good as one you would submit for a dream job.

**Submit: Link to job posting and upload letter.**

## 2. Reflection on Learning Experiences

Complete this [exercise](./reflections_on_learning.md) to reflect on your learning experience thus far here at Turing.

**Submit: Link to gist.**

## 3. Number Guesser

Complete phases 1-3 of [Number Guesser](./number_guesser.md). You _can_ use jQuery for this. The project spec provides a layout comp - we advise you do _some_ work to make your app resemble the app, but the bulk of your time should be spent on learning to manipulate the DOM with JavaScript.

On a branch called `annotated`, annotate every line of JavaScript (either below/above the line in a comment) to explain what the code is doing. Include any explanation as to why you used ES5 vs. ES6 functions, var vs. let vs. const, etc.

**Submit: Link to Number Guesser Repo AND GitHub Pages deployment link. Make sure this includes the `annotated` branch.**

## 4. JavaScript without a Browser

While JavaScript was originally intended to be a client-side scripting language, it has since made its way server-side thanks to Node.js. We're now able to use the same language for browser-based interactions as well as server-side scripts.

Let's get introduced to JavaScript without a browser. Work through [this lesson](http://backend.turing.io/module4/lessons/javascript_without_a_browser). It will introduce you to Node.js and basic unit-testing using Mocha.

**Submit: Nothing. But you should still do it.**

## 5. Sorting Suite

Complete Sorting Suite in Javascript [here](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/sorting-suite.html). Choose **one** out of the three fundamental sorting algorithms to complete. Use Node.js to run your code, and Mocha/Chai to write your tests. FE2 gets this as a project, so we'll use their project requirements, but you can ignore the rubric. You won't be graded. We just want you to get some practice testing and writing JavaScript.

**Submit: Link to repo for Sorting Suite.**

  - Array Cardio Day 2
  - Objects and Arrays
  - Tally String Times with Reduce

Some biggies if you're coming from Ruby:

-   Methods are called Functions
-   You should know the difference between `undefined` and `null`; JS does not have a `nil` like Ruby does
-   `require`ing a file you've written does nothing if you didn't export from that file
-   All `return`s are explicit in Javascript. If you don't use the word `return`, your return value will be `undefined`

Google is your friend. It's totally reasonable to type things like ".each in javascript" or "what is const in javascript"
