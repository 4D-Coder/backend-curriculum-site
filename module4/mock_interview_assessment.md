title: Module 4 Mock Interview Assessment
---

Each student will be asked a variety of technical questions during the Mock Interview in a one-on-one setting with an instructor who will be acting as the interviewer.

Topics **may** include the following:

* Testing
* Object Oriented Programming
* Ruby and JavaScript Fundamentals
* Debugging Techniques
* How the Web Works
* Database Design
* Web Framework Fundamentals
* Professional Work Flow
* Authentication and Authorization

## Rubric

This assessment is intended to ensure that each student has the fundamental knowledge to graduate from Turing and give each student a sense of what a technical interview may entail.

The bar for "meeting expectations" for this assessment is as follows:

### 1. Professionalism

Student arrived early / on time. Student came adequately-prepared (i.e., with a writing utensil) and looks presentable. Student responded to answers with a professional tone that represents them well.

*  Above Expectations
*  Meets Expectations
*  Below Expectations

### 2. Communication

The student engages in a reasonable amount of eye contact and nonverbal communication. The student can clearly articulate their response to the question and shares their thought process in a logical, well-organized manner. If the student is unclear about something, they ask for clarity or feedback from their interviewer.

*  Above Expectations
*  Meets Expectations
*  Below Expectations

### 3. Technical Accuracy

The student answers the questions with accuracy. If the student does not know the answer or is making an educated guess, they communicate this to the interviewer.

*  Above Expectations
*  Meets Expectations
*  Below Expectations

### 4. Technical Detail

Student is specific and detailed when responding to questions. The student gives appropriate examples to support their responses. When students contribute their opinion (both positive and negative), they demonstrate they can think critically and understand different perspectives on a topic.

*  Above Expectations
*  Meets Expectations
*  Below Expectations
