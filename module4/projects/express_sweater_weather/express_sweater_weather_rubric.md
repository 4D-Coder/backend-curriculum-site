## Rubric

You will be graded by an instructor on the criteria below. The rubric below outlines the key areas in which you will be graded. The rubric items below are in order of importance in how you will be graded for this final project.

### Project Management/Agile Practices

- 4: Developer satisfies all criteria below in section three. Developer creates 10 additional cards that focus on research spikes, code reviews, and chores for dedicated code refactors. Developer creates additional agile board columns for quality assurance, code review, and current deployments.

- 3: Developer regularly uses an agile board of their choosing. Before starting to code, they write user stories that focus on each individual feature that will be created in the application. Each user story will contain a descriptive title in relation to the feature being built. Each user story will also contain information pertaining to the feature being built within the description of the card. This may include steps that a user may need to do in order to achieve their goal, or expected request/response data that may be seen during the use of an API. Developer is able to articulate the agile process during the project evaluation.

- 2: Developer creates an agile board but uses it sparingly after the initial start date of the project. Developer creates a few stories but never pulls them into their respective columns at the appropriate time. Most stories do not have written descriptions.

- 1: Developer creates an agile board but doesn't utilize it for the duration of the project.

### Git Workflow

- 4: Developer satisfies all criteria below in section three. Developer demonstrates their git workflow as being 100% consistent in regards to the creation of branches, issuing pull requests, using PR templates, asking for feedback, and writing clear and concise commit messages.  

- 3: For each feature listed on their agile board, the developer has created a branch on git. Developer pushes their changes to their respective branches found on Github. Developer opens pull requests for every branch they create. All commit messages will be in present tense, start with a capital letter, and be consistent for the duration of the project. If on a paired or group project, developers must tag other collaborators in their PR's and ask for feedback before merging in their changes.

- 2: Developer creates pull requests on separate branches but often pushes directly to master. Developer is inconsistent in how they write commit messages. Some commit messages lack clarity and purpose for the code submitted. Developer may tag collaborators at times.

- 1: Developer only pushes to master, never creates branches for their features work, and has very few commit messages at the end of the project. Commit messages are not informative and lack clarity as to what each piece of code is focused on. Commit messages are not consistent and lack proper structure across the project history.

### Documentation

NOTE - we will be evaluating both your FE project from Mod4 and your API completed in Mod3 for this category.

- 4: Developer satisfies all criteria below in section three. Developer contributes additional information. This includes links to their agile board and any available production links.

- 3: A thorough README is found in all related repositories. A README contains sections such as Introduction, Initial Setup, How to Use, Known Issues, Running Tests, How to Contribute, Core Contributors, Schema Design, and Tech Stack List. If the product is front-end focused, screenshots of the application will be required. Each section is thoroughly filled in with important information for visitors of your application's repo.

- 2: A thorough README is found in all related repositories. A README contains sections such as Introduction, Initial Setup, How to Use, Known Issues, Running Tests, How to Contribute, Core Contributors, Schema Design, and Tech Stack List. Each section is not filled out thoroughly, or some are missing.

- 1: A default README is found in all related repositories. No additional sections have been added. Developer has not added any related information to the project.

### Communication

- 4: The developer requested a PR review from a peer, implemented the feedback and communicated back to the reviewer what changes were made and was able to speak to that experience, whether it be technical learning focused or workflow focused.

- 3: The developer requested a PR review from a peer, implemented the feedback and communicated back to the reviewer what changes were made. The developer was prepared during all check-ins and reached out to instructors if at any time there were blockers they thought might prevent them from meeting any deadlines. The developer presented their application and workflow in the evaluation in a way that was professional (think - how would you talk about this application, the challenges and decisions, etc. in an interview?).

- 2: The developer requested a PR review from one individual, implemented the feedback and communicated back to the reviewer what changes were made. The developer was prepared during all check-ins and reached out to instructors if at any time there were blockers they thought might prevent them from meeting any deadlines. The developer was able to speak to their application, challenges, decisions, etc. but required some prompting from the instructor.

- 1: The developer did not have any successful PR requests.
