## Introduction

Pearson's Law:

> "That which is measured improves. That which is measured and reported improves exponentially." - Karl Pearson

Technology has enabled us to measure more, and shorten the period between measurement and reporting. Sensors are cheaper and smaller, computers are everywhere, and we can access data from anywhere. People who have recognized this, and applied it to themselves are part of a movement called "Quantified Self."

You are going to build a simple calorie tracker.

## Learning Goals

* Create a front-end to consume the Rails/Express API built for QS.
* Create an Express API given specified endpoints and response formats.
* Review and refactor code (in each of the three languages) so that it:
    * is well organized
    * clearly communicates intent
    * utilizes abstraction to hide complexity
    * breaks problems down into small methods/functions with a single responsibility
