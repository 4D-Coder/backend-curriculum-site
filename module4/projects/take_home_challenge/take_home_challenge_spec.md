# Take Home Challenge

For your Week 6 solo project, you will complete, submit, and defend a 'take home challenge' as you would in many interview processes. Your evaluation will take into account your communication to your prospective employer once you receive the challenge, your quality of work (code and design and thought behind it), and your ability to present and communicate your process/rationale for decisions, code, challenges, and wins.

## Your challenge

Your challenge will be sent to you via DM from your instructors. Some challenges provide more direction than others, although all have some degree of choice/freedom/decision-making on your part. You are welcome to respond to the DM with a couple of clarifying questions, but keep in mind that you are treating this like an actual interview process - the questions should be as clearly and professionally asked as you would in an email, as well as your responses to whatever answer you get. It probably wouldn't be ideal that you attempt to have several back-and-forths with a potential employer - part of what they are looking for in you, especially as a junior, is how much initiative you can take without hand-holding. Not having over-clarification, like you commonly do on curriculum projects, may raise concern for you about 'passing' the project. We have provided a rubric so you know how you will be evaluated, and you know the general expectations at Turing. We are looking for your best work and presentation of yourself and your work. _Build something you are proud of and you will pass._

Another note - at first glance, your challenge may not appear to require the skills you have that you believe to be most valuable. **Be creative** - how can you design an app that meets this criteria AND displays your skills? Without complete over-engineering, it is totally possible to 'spin' every prompt provided to show your technical strengths, we promiseðŸ˜Š

## Timeline

The challenges will be provided to you between 10-10:30 on Friday of Week 5, and are due by 8am on Wednesday of Week 6. One of your instructors will meet with you sometime Wednesday for you to present what you built to us, as you would to a prospective employee in a final interview.

## Submission

Please DM both instructors the email message would you send to your prospective employee, including the repo and deployed link. This message should be received by 8am on Wednesday of Week 6.

## Rubric

The rubric can be found [here](./take_home_challenge_rubric). The rubric below outlines the key areas in which you will be graded. The rubric items below are in order of importance in how you will be graded for this final project.
