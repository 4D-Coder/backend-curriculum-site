## MoveTime
Create a tool that people who are considering moving can get some data points on for a prospective city:
- What is the cost of living?
- What is the population?
At least 2 more considerations, from the following or based on your own ideas:
- What is the walkability score? Bike-ability score?
- Proximity to airport
- Cost of vehicle registration
- Cost of gas
Users should be able to "favorite" and "eliminate" cities, and see their master list of favorites. If they re-search for an eliminated city, they should still be able to access the data but should receive a friendly reminder that they eliminated it.
Consider how you will make sure all of the numbers are put into perspective for your user, so that they all have meaning.

Use this API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to build an app that... 
• Option 1: Setup Auth somehow so that step 3 can be saved for each user. A user should get some (you choose how many) photos of dogs, and should have the option to "like" them. A user can see all photos they've liked, and unlike if they change their mind.
• Option 2: No auth; anyone who goes to the sit sees the same thing. Visitors can rate dog photos cuteness 11/10, 12/10, 13/10 or higher! They can then filter dog photos by cuteness level.
