## NASA Follower
Build a web app for NASA lovers that has the following features:
- A user arrives to your page and sees the NASA picture of the day and NASA's tweets.

## MoveTime
Create a tool that people who are considering moving can get some data points on for a prospective city:
- What is the cost of living?
- What is the population?
At least 2 more considerations, from the following or based on your own ideas:
- What is the walkability score? Bike-ability score?
- Proximity to airport
- Cost of vehicle registration
- Cost of gas
Users should be able to "favorite" and "eliminate" cities, and see their master list of favorites. If they re-search for an eliminated city, they should still be able to access the data but should receive a friendly reminder that they eliminated it.
Consider how you will make sure all of the numbers are put into perspective for your user, so that they all have meaning.

## DogCEOTime
Use this API (https://dog.ceo/dog-api/) to build an app that...
• Option 1: Setup Auth somehow so that step 3 can be saved for each user. A user should get some (you choose how many) photos of dogs, and should have the option to "like" them. A user can see all photos they've liked, and unlike if they change their mind.
• Option 2: No auth; anyone who goes to the site sees the same thing. Visitors can rate dog photos cuteness 11/10, 12/10, 13/10 or higher! They can then filter dog photos by cuteness level.
