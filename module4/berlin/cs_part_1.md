# CS for Interviews, Part 1: Base Understandings

## Learning Goals

* Students will have a basic understanding of what types of challenges they can expect in a technical interview
* Students will understand the limited scope of Computer Science that appears in technical interviews
* Students will build a linked list to illustrate the concept of a data structure
* Students will practice iterating on algorithmically-challenging code in a short period of time

## Warm Up

1. Are you a Computer Scientist? Why or why not?
2. Why do you think Computer Science topics like data structures and algorithms are the focus of some technical interviews?
3. If you were asked "What kind of CS topics have you studied?" what would you answer? Can you come up with at least five specific examples?

## S1: Understanding the Technical Interview (45 minutes)

Let's set some context by discussing the following:

1. Where do technical interviews typically fall in the hiring sequence?
2. What questions does the technical interview attempt to answer?
3. What are the common formats for a technical interview?

### TPS: Technical Interview Mindset

1. Given that context, do you think the technical interview will be a strength or weakness of your interview process? Why?
2. What do you think you can individually improve or practice to do your best in a technical interview?

### Technical Interview Buckets

Live (in-person or remote) technical interviews generally fall into one of these buckets:

1. 60 minutes to solve a puzzle or challenge from scratch
2. 30+ minutes to iterate on or refactor your previously submitted take-home challenge solution
3. 60-90 minutes of pairing with a developer at the company to write new features or solve a puzzle
4. 60+ minutes to independently add a feature or fix a bug in an existing app that you haven't seen before

### Pathways to Technical Interview Success

#### 1. Exposure to Common Puzzles

* There is a large set of potential topics and puzzles
* There are a small set of puzzles and concepts that pop up a significant percentage of the time
* [Some common puzzles are collected in turingschool/challenges](https://github.com/turingschool/challenges)
* These are the kinds of things you should be practicing regularly now and throughout the job hunt. 30-60 minutes 3+ times/week would be great.
* There are many sites with other examples like [Exercism](https://exercism.io/) or [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/)

*In pairs*: Have you used any resources like that to practice already? What have you learned?

#### 2. Practice with Data Structures & Algorithms

* If you got a CS degree, you'd spend at least two semester-long classes on DSA
* If you've written implementations of each of the common ones two or three times, you're well equipped to succeed
* Common data structures: Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues, Binary Trees, Graphs
* Common sorting algorithms: Bubble, Merge, Insertion, Binary Tree

*In pairs*: Remember doing some of these before? Did they feel fun and interesting or boring and dumb? Why?

#### 3. Defining a Process

* What do you do when you don't know what to do?
* In flight school, you learn to Aviate, Navigate, Communicate
* If you just "do programming", you'll fail and look bad doing it
* You need to know what your process is and make it easy to get started
* Make the easy things easy: how do you set up your environment? Files? Tests?
* Define success: how will you know when you're done?
* Start small: iterate, learn, prove your progress -- not just one big leap
* Practice being loud and talking it out

*In pairs*: If you jumped into a 60 minutes code challenge right now, what would be the first three things you'd do?

#### 4. Intentional Practice Not Stupid Practice

* Most people missed the point on the idea of "10,000 hours"
* If it were just a matter of stacking hours, every worker with five years experience could be "world-class"
* Intentional practice means breaking down complex processes and practicing the skills in isolation and combination
* If you're working on your free-throws in basketball, you take 50 shots where you're focused on the flick of your wrist
* 50 shots where you focus on the last moment your fingertip touches the basketball
* 50 shots focused on the movement in your hips and knees
* Not just 150 free throws and hope you get better

*In pairs*: Have you ever practiced a skill with real intention? What was it and why were you trying to get better?

### Conclusions

* Technical interviews are not real programming, they are a circus trick
* Like a Rubik's cube, if you know the right steps to take then you can look like a genius
* You can practice and be prepared because success is dependent on process not knowledge
* There is knowledge and familiarity worth building to solidify your confidence

Discuss technical interviews and the main categories of challenges they can expect
Explore the "computer science" category and what some typical questions might look like
Introduce the general idea of data structures and why we (sometimes) care about them
Work through an introductory data structure problem (adding, searching, counting a linked list)
Work through an intermediate data structure problem (inserting, deleting, reversing a linked list)
