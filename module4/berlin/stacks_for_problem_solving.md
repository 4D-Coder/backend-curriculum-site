title: Stacks for Problem Solving
layout: page
---

Let's talk about stacks.

## Learning Goals

* Learn Stuff.

## The Matching Problem

* Read the problem
* Spend about 3 minutes writing pseudocode about how you'd go about solving it

## Quick Introduction to Stacks

### Concept

* A way to maintain state

### Implementation

* Use an array

### Example

## Work Session

* Work solo on The Matching Problem using a stack
* Carefully consider the "edge cases", for example:
  * What about an empty `""` input?
  * What about just a close `")"`?
  * What about too many closes `"())"`
  * Are any other characters allowed like `"( [ ] )"`?

### Review

1. Were you able to get the stack concept working for pairing parentheses?
2. What about more complex cases?
3. If you didn't use a stack, how would you try to solve this problem?
