# Hashing

---

# Choose a Snack

- Choose one snack for yourself
- Resist the temptation & do NOT open it yet

---

# Learning Goals

* Instructors will be able to explain what hashing is and where it is used in the real world
* Instructors will be able to ...

^ KEY POINTS:
- There is no way to take the hash and go back to original string
- Inputs can be any size
- Outputs will always be the same size
- Any slight change of input results in drastic changes of output

---

# Count the Letters

NOT including spaces, find the number of characters in your snack's string. Spell it correctly.

^ Snacks:
- fruitsnacks
- chips
- twizzlers
- M&Ms

---

# SnackLength % 6

This should result in a number 0-5.
Drop your snack off in the bin with your number on it.

# Collision

When a hash function produces the same hash for two different inputs

^ This shouldn't happen a lot - but what if we had ten snack options? We still only have 6 snack boxes.
The main solution is to use a more advanced hash function. (Even then, we may run into collisions, but we aren't going to focus on that today.)

# A Better Hash Function
