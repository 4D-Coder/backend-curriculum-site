## Welcome to Mod4 and Interview Prep timeðŸŽ‰

As you are preparing for technical interviews, there is a myriad of things you can do to set yourself up for success. Several opportunities for practice have been built into the Mod4 curriculum to support you in this. It can be easy to get overwhelmed by all the things you can do, so we recommend making a plan and using your time well, devoted to a few specific strategies to prep.

1. This is required, but participate in curriculum interview prep. This includes:
  - 3 decent-sized code challenges (in-class)
  - 1 white-boarding session (in-class)
  - Wheel of Jeopardy (practice answering questions on the spot, for technical accuracy and eloquence, in-class)
  - Weekly Interview Questions/Flashcards

2. Practice answering weekly interview questions, out loud. To a human (or canine). Practice what you will do when you don't know the answer to a question. This should include behavioral and technical questions.

3. Sign up for at least 2 mock interviews during Mod4. Interviewers get booked up quick, so sign up earlier than later to ensure a spot. It also holds you accountable. Find them under the [`Practice` category](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_four/interview_prep_resources.md).

4. Set aside ~3 1-hour time slots a week, or ~30 minutes a day to practice code challenges. Decide on [codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) or [exercism](https://exercism.io/) or something else, and stick with it. Don't hop around to all eighty-four websites that basically offer the same thing. Push yourself to do this regularly and increase the level of rigor for the challenges you are attacking.
