## Overview

Module 4 is the capstone: a demonstration of the best of what students are capable of. It prepares them for the workplace by emulating the patterns, processes, and collaboration that theyâ€™ll use. It should prepare them for their career by helping them set goals and direction without dictating every step of the journey.
