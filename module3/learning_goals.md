## Skill Proficiencies

Academic success in B3 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique

## Mastery

### Project Management

* Students use pull requests to organize discussion about features.

### Interpersonal Skills

* Students formulate questions by synthesizing what was expected vs what was observed.
* Students explain intent and execution of their code.

### Self-Directed Learning

* Students find resources online or in print to help them learn new technologies.
* Students read documentation and implement strategies described.
* Students ask meaningful questions.
    * Example: Don't ask "How do I get this to work?" Instead, mention what has been tried, what happened, what was expected with a goal of understanding where you have made a wrong assumption.

### Agile Processes

* Students verify acceptance requirements using automated testing.

### Advanced Rails

* Students are able to develop and test secure internal APIs using Rails.
* Students are able to consume external APIs and test the consumption.

## Functional

### Project Management

* Students communicate with product owners with regard to missing deadlines.
* Students introduce how acceptance requirements are turned into stories and feature requirements.

### Interpersonal Skills

* Students collaborate with teammates with tools that could be used by remote teams.
* Students communicate around code, explaining what it does and why.
* Students document intent and usage of their code for effective collaboration.
* Students use pull requests to organize discussion about features.

### Self-Directed Learning

* Students utilize mentors and other community members to identify and discuss the merits of various implementations.

### Agile Processes

* Students use an agile process to turn acceptance requirements into deployed software.
* Students translate acceptance requirements into user stories that are ready for work.

### Advanced Rails

* Students are able to send email from a Rails app.
* Students compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases.
* Students utilize and debug the Rails asset pipeline locally and in production.

### JavaScript in the Browser

## Familiarity

### Project Management

* Students understand the process by which business requirements are turned into acceptance requirements.
* Students utilize project management tools to communicate across technical teams and stakeholders/clients.

### Interpersonal Skills

* Students implement feedback from a code review to improve quality.
* Students provide feedback in the form of a code review to improve quality and share knowledge.

### Advanced Rails

* Students are able to contrast the different approaches between working on greenfield and brownfield projects.
* Students are able to critique previous projects for fundamental security flaws and understand how to prevent them.

### App Performance

* Students are able to explain when to use caching strategies to improve performance in Rails.
* Students are able to explain the scenarios that would benefit from using background workers in Rails.

### JavaScript in the Browser

* Students are able to make API calls using `fetch` calls.

### PostgreSQL & SQL

* Students intelligently structure/normalize data so as to maintain reasonable performance as the data size increases.
* Students use the CLI to understand the structure and data of their database (ex: list databases, tables, table structure).
* Students implement indexes to address slow queries.
