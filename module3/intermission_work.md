# Assignments to Prep for Module 3

## Most Important

### Professional Development

* Do [this](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/blob/master/module_three/pre_work.md)

### HTTP Request/Response

**Using paper and a writing utensil:**

* On one piece of paper, write out all of the parts of an example HTTP GET request
* On a separate piece of paper, write out an example 200 response to that request with all of the parts
* **Bonus** write your explanation as a metaphor
* Bring this to class day 1. This is your ticket into Mod 3 :)


### SQL/ActiveRecord

Entering Module 3 with a solid understanding of ActiveRecord and SQL is key to getting the module off to a good start. Make sure you are able to write and understand queries that involve multiple `JOIN` statements and that combine math functions.

1. Complete and understand the [Intermediate SQL I](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/intermediate_sql.md) challenges.
1. Complete and understand the [Intermediate SQL II](https://gist.github.com/case-eee/5affe7fd452336cef2c88121e8d49f5d) challenges.
1. Complete and understand [ActiveRecord American Gladiators](https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/active_record_american_gladiators.md). Make sure that you review, (http://backend.turing.io/module2/misc/active_record_obstacle_course)[ActiveRecord Obstacle Course].

## Next Most Important

### Deeply Nested Hashes

This will be important for when you start consuming APIs.

Fork and clone [Here Be Dragons](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/here-be-dragons)

Complete the exercises within and submit a link to your repo no later than Saturday before the first day of class.

### Rails Routing

Rewrite your Monster Shop `routes.rb`:

Module 3 requires you to know URLs, paths and HTTP verbs inside and out. Rewrite the routes file for your Monster Shop to use only methods that map directly to HTTP verbs: `get`, `post`, `put`, `patch` and `delete`. You will probably need to add `to:` and `as:` parameters to make sure your apps continue to work, and tests continue to pass.

If you wrote your routes that way already, replace them using `resources`.

If you do not own the repo for your project, fork it, and rewrite the routes file individually.

NOTE: This is not because one way is better, but it's extremely important to understand what every line of your routes file is doing. Rails Engine demands a solid understanding of Rails routing.

### Data Structures And Algorithms

We are going to be covering various data structures to prepare you for the job hunt and technical interviews. Complete this former M1 project, [Jungle Beats](https://backend.turing.io/module1/projects/jungle_beat)

## For futher exploration

### JavaScript/JQuery (What's this JavaScript I keep hearing about?)

[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/)

JavaScript is the scripting language of web browsers. During Module 3 we'll start getting our first introductions to JS and we'd like you to work through some basic materials as a preparation.

You are to complete Chapters 1-5 of Eloquent Javascript.

We are mainly looking for you to get experience with the syntax, and at a minimumum you should understand the JS Data Types, Conditionals, and Looping.

[jQuery](https://www.codeschool.com/courses/try-jquery)

JQuery is a popular javascript library for manipulating the content of web pages. Dip your toes in with this introductory Jquery class.
