### Exploration Topic Ideas

- Additional API consumption
- Add functionality such that a user must accept an invite to a movie party
- Implement basic authentication for a user 
    * require a password field to user registration, and create log in and loggin out functionality 
    * utilize sessions/cookies to remember a logged in user
- Implement low level, server side caching for API calls
