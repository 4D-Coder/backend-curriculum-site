You are working for a company developing an E-Commerce Application. Your team is working in a service-oriented architecture, meaning the front and back ends of this application are separate and communicate via APIs. Your job is to expose the data that powers the site through an API that the front end will consume.

## Learning Goals

* Expose an API.
* Use serializers to format json responses
* Test API exposure
* Compose advanced ActiveRecord queries to analyze information stored in SQL databases.
* Write basic SQL statements without the assistance of an ORM.
* Make API calls using javascript `fetch` calls.
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM.

## Project Management

The organization of this project spec is by feature type. However, much of the unfamiliar or more difficult work is in the business intelligence portion of the project. To the degree possible instructors encourage you to use an agile approach to completing this assignment. Furthermore, we encourage you to review the work and develop estimated milestones before you begin. **Any good set of milestones will allow for some slippage before the project is due.**

There is an Advanced ActiveRecord class scheduled for Wednesday. We *highly* encourage you to have attempted some of the business intelligence queries before that class.

## What to expect from instructors

There will not be formal check-ins for this project. Instructors will generally be available during scheduled work time to discuss issues absent other commitments. Students should also view this as an opportunity to practice discussing code on GitHub, and instructors will prefer reviewing PRs to discussing code on Slack.

In their reviews, instructors will go over whatever technical, planning or other challenges you're having. They also may give you feedback, or suggest a different path than the one you're on.

## Rails Driver

[Rails Driver](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/rails_driver) is the front end of the application. It includes a test suite as well as a front end to test your application. Instructors will use this to determine the completion of your project.

It should be noted that in most professional applications, the front end would not be written in Rails. More likely, a pure front end application would use a Javascript framework such as React. However, in order to make this portion of the project more understandable to BEM3 students we have written it in Rails.
