## Beginner Extension Learning Goals

* Continue practicing exposing API endpoints

Build out the CRUD functionality for Orders


## Advanced Extension Learning Goals

* Make API calls using javascript `fetch` calls.
* Use jQuery to traverse and manipulate the DOM.

Below are stories for you to try if you feel confident in the project learning goals. Complete the these stories on the Front End, Rails Driver:

Story 1:

```
As a user, when I visit /items/:id
then I should see the name of the merchant associated with that item
```

Story 2:

```
As a user, when I visit /admin/merchants/:id
then I should see the revenue that merchant has generated
```

Story 3:

```
As a user, when I visit /items
Then I should see an input to search for an item by name
When I fill in that input with some text
And I click the button 'Search for Item'
Then I should see a list of items with names that match my input
```

Story 4:

```
As a user, when I visit /admin
And I fill in the search field
And I click the "Search for Merchants" button
And I click the "Search for Merchants" button again,
Then I should not see duplicate results
```
