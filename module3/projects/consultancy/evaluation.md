## Evaluation at a High Level

Project evaluation will be done on a continual basis through check-ins and the final evaluation. Teams will have checkbox items to complete. To achieve a 3(_meets expectations_) in each category all checkboxes above the 4 criteria should be completed.

Typically, scores higher than 3.0 will be for going "above and beyond" expectations, learning tools and implementing concepts we don't teach in class. Each category has specific criteria to help guide the 'above and beyond' goals.

However, we will not reward "heroics". Staying up late, pulling all-nighters, is not what this project is about. We're here to work together as a team, and solo efforts will generally be discouraged by your project managers.

The rubric consists of four categories:

[Feature Delivery](./evaluation/feature_delivery)
[Technical Quality](./evaluation/technical_quality)
[Testing](./evaluation/testing)
[Presentation & Documentations](./evaluation/presentation_documentation)
