title: Rails Engine Lite Feedback Session (Eval)
length: 1 week
type: project
---

The 'eval' for this project is going to be a bit different than other projects in the past. We are relying on you to score yourself for this project. To do that, please submit this form. 

## Feedback Session Format

Instead of a traditional eval, you will be meeting in small groups to get feedback from your peers as well as an instructor. The format of this feedback session will be:

### Part 1: Feedback Request
Choose at least one part of your project that youâ€™d like specific feedback on. Everyone will be asked to bring this to the feedback session, and you will be able to get feedback from your instructor as well as your peers in the feedback group.

### Part 2: Behavioral Question
Your instructor will ask you to answer one of the following questions. You will not know which question will be asked, so please be prepared to answer any.
1. Tell me about a time that you found yourself in an unproductive struggle. What did you do to get yourself unblocked? How has that affected your approach to working on tough problems?
2. How comfortable are you with getting uncomfortable with a new-to-you concept? Can you give me an example of a time when you didn't know how to do something right away, but found a way to get it done?
3. Did you ever have to switch gears in the middle of this project? How did you react?
4. Describe your strengths. How have you seen these in practice on this project?
5. Throughout your time in Mod 3 thus far, have you been able to identify any areas of growth? What's your plan going forward to strengthen that area?
