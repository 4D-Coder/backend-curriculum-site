We will be using an agile process during the development of this project. This will include:

* Using GitHub
* Setting up Continuous Integration
* Using a project management tool such as Github Projects or Trello.
* Conducting Story Grooming meetings
* Doing daily Stand Ups
* Demoing your project to your Project Manager
* Holding Team Retros

## GitHub

* Commit Frequently
* Make branches and submit Pull Requests for each new feature.
    * DO NOT commit directly to master
    * Keep your PRs as small as possible (one feature per PR)
    * Your PR should be review by at least one team member before it is merged.
    * Tag your Project Manager if you have questions. DM your Project Manager letting them know you have tagged them.

## Continuous Integration

* Set up a [CI Server](http://backend.turing.io/module3/lessons/ci_and_staging_environments)
* Timebox this activity to 2 hours. If you don't get it working in 2 hours, create a branch with your work, but don't merge it.

## Story Grooming

* You should be using a project management tool to keep track of your stories.
* When doing a "Story Grooming" you should:
    * Make sure that the project board is up to date
    * Look over the current backlog of stories and decide if you want to make any changes
        * Are there any stories that need to be updated?
        * Are there any stories that need to be added?
    * Assign stories to individual team members or pairs
        * Be clear on what it is that everyone should be doing
* You should be Story Grooming every 1-2 days.

## Daily Stand Ups

* A Stand Up is a very brief (hence, physically standing up) meeting for the development team to keep in touch about what everyone is doing.
* During the stand up, each member of the team will take 1 - 2 minutes to answer these questions:
    * What have you been working on?
    * What are you going to be working on?
    * Is anything blocking you?
* Every weekday you should send your PM a summary of the day's stand up.

## Project Check Ins

* During a Project Check In, you should be prepared to:
    * Demo your application in a deployed environment (Heroku)
    * Show your up to date project board
    * Ask clarifying questions
    * Do a code review
    * Set expectations for the following project check in

## Retros

* **End of Week 1**
    * Students should discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and what they would like to change for the second half of the project. Students should use their DTR as a guideline for this discussion and be willing to reaffirm or change any expectations that weren't met in the first week.
* **End of Project**
    * Students should discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and what feedback they have for their team members using [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDybiSiZLVdbpbwEU-x_VPakyhhX0lD4HhcCjwuxtc4/edit#gid=0). Each group should make a copy of the template and submit to their instructors.
