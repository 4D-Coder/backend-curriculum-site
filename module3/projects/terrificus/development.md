## Milestones & Agile Process

You will meet with instructors periodically during the project. The goals of each check-in roughly what should be completed before the check-in is listed below.

### Setup

* Create a board on Pivotal Tracker and invite your PM as a contributor.
* Before you begin to implement code, write up 5-10 stories on your new Pivotal Tracker board. These stories must be written in present tense.
* Once step two is complete, send your tracker board over to your PM.
* Setup a [CI Server](http://backend.turing.io/module3/lessons/ci_and_staging_environments)

### Pull Requests

* For each story you create, there will be an associated story ID number. You'll use this in your pull requests.
* PR's must be formatted as the following: 123456: Add user to database table, 789101: Add get_all action for user resource, 194385: Add create action for user resource, etc
* Copy and paste the story URL into the PR. Tag your PM if you have specific questions. No need to have our approval to merge unless there is an issue that needs to be resolved.
* Once you have run through and completed your original story list, write an additional 5-10 stories and send us a notification that they have been written. We'll be expecting to see consistent updates.

### "Standup" and Checkins

* Every weekday at 2PM send your PM a remote "daily standup" style update via Slack that answers the following questions:
  * What have you been working on?
  * What are you going to be working on?
  * Is anything blocking you?
* Every two days you will commit to the work you will have complete over the next two days and a specific time it will be complete. Work with your PM to determine when this will be.

## Retros

**End of Week 1**

Students should discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and what they would like to change for the second half of the project. Students should use their DTR as a guideline for this discussion and be willing to reaffirm or change any expectations that weren't met in the first week.

**End of Project**

Students should discuss what went well, what didn't go well, and what feedback they have for their team members using [this template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MDybiSiZLVdbpbwEU-x_VPakyhhX0lD4HhcCjwuxtc4/edit#gid=0). Each group should make a copy of the template and submit to their instructors.
