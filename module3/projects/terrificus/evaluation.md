### Feature Delivery

* **4:** Team well exceeded project manager's expectations.
* **3:** Team completed all the user stories and requirements set by the project manager.
* **2:** Team completed most user stories set out but fell short of project manager's expectations.
* **1:** Team fell well short of project manager's expectations.

### Technical Quality

* **4:**  Project demonstrates extractions that are above and beyond and might include SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) or takes on a new technology that outside the scope of the curriculum and includes all below expectations.
* **3:**  Project uses abstraction in ways that make it easy to change (example: if an API changes, Propublica to Google Civic, we make changes in as few places as possible). Project shows a solid understanding of MVC principles (this may include but is not limited to: no logic in views, clean controllers, serializers and presenters to handle formatting rather than models etc.) and includes all below expectations.
* **2:**  MVC is overall good but might have logic or hashes in views, formatting in models, or controllers with complex logic and includes all below expectations.
* **1:**  Project has significant gaps in understanding of MVC and with several examples of logic or hashes in view, controllers remain un-refactored, and models are used for formatting.

### Testing
* **4:** Project demonstrates exceptional testing using advanced techniques such as spies. And includes below expectations.
* **3:** Project demonstrates high value testing at different layers (above 90%) and I would be happy paying for the test suite. And includes below expectations.
* **2:** Test suite coverage is greater than 80% but misses the most meaningful functionality and I would not be happy paying for/inheriting it. And includes below expectations.
* **1:** Test suite coverage is low (less than 80%). And includes below expectations.

### Product Experience

* **4:** User experience is exceptional, page is easy to use, responsive, and meets all of the criteria in 3. Page load times average under 300 milliseconds.
* **3:** Project is ready to demo. Page load times average under 500 milliseconds with a max page load time of 600 milliseconds using New Relic or Skylight.io in production on a hosted service.
* **2:** Project is not ready to demo or page load times average are slower than 600 milliseconds on average.
* **1:** Project is not ready to demo, does not measure page load times, page load times are over 700 milliseconds on average, or max page load takes longer than 1000 milliseconds.
