## Background

An Inception is a process used by many companies in the Software Industry to design a solution to a problem. It is tempting to take a problem and immediately start coding, however this will often result in an incoherent solution, or even worse, a solution to the **wrong** problem.

Usually this process takes several days involving many stakeholders such as the client(s), team leads, CEOs, operations, etc. We will be doing a simplified version of this process in a few hours between your team and your project manager.

## Process

Each of the following meetings has a purpose, Brainstorm or Decide. Everyone should try hard to stick to that purpose.

* Brainstorm - Explore what is possible, what can go wrong, what is not possible, debate, share counterpoints etc.
* Decide - Follows brainstorming and requires the team to put aside their pride and make decisions for the sake of the team.

Conflict and tension tends to arise in groups when there are differing expectations of these meetings. Some want to debate and explore different outcomes while others see that as a waste of time and want to make a decision. The reality is both are important for making sound decisions and the following is a template to do both and get your project off to a strong start.

## Problem Definition and Idea Sharing (Brainstorm)

* **Time Limit:**
    * 20 minutes (More ideas will come up throughout the project and that's OK.)
* **Objectives:**
    * Define the problem you are solving in 2-3 sentences. The solution you come up with later should solve the problem directly.
    * Discuss and debate the technical solution to the problem, thinking through the most important features this application would need in order to solve the problem.
* **Instructions**
    * The format of this meeting is an open discussion about the objectives defined above.
    * Don't spend more than 5 minutes defining the problem.
    * Don't spend more than 5 minutes on any one feature. Remember, this is just a brainstorming session.
    * Do not eliminate any ideas during this meeting.
    * No decisions are made during this meeting
    * Allow everyone's voice to be heard and make sure no one is dominating the discussion.
    * Be creative. Share bad ideas as well as good. Sometimes bad ideas lead to good ones.
    * Use the guiding questions below if you get stuck.
* **Guiding Questions**
    * What would set you apart during demo night?
    * What intimidates you but would be amazing to pull off?
    * What features or technology choices would spark interesting discussions during job interviews?
    * Would you use this product? If not, what is it missing?

## Feature Dump (Brainstorm)

* **Time Limit**
    * 15 minutes
* **Objectives**
    * Write out as many potential features as possible
* **Instructions**
    * This is an **individual** activity
    * Each person should write out features on Sticky Notes
    * Only 1 feature per sticky note
    * Features should describe user interaction in 3-5 words max.
    * Features should be written using a sharpie to help ensure the above word Limit
    * Examples include:
        * User profile creation
        * User sees stats over time
        * Email notifications
    * **If you cannot fit a feature on a single sticky note you are doing it wrong. You are probably providing implementation details. These feature descriptions should describe user interaction and should not be tied to implementing the feature in a specific way**
    * All potential features of the app should be included (we will define the MVP later in the  process)
    * Get creative with potential features. There are no wrong answers.

## Feature Sharing/Elimination of Duplicates (Decide)

* **Time Limit**
    * 20 minutes
* **Objectives**
    * Share what came out of the feature dump
    * Group related ideas into broad categories (EPICs)
    * Eliminate duplicate ideas
* **Instructions**
    * Utilize a large blank wall or sheet of chart paper
    * Each person should present their features one at a time, giving a *brief* description of what that feature is, so it is clear for the whole group.
    * After you have described the feature stick it on the wall or chart paper.
    * As each person takes a turn you will notice that some of the features will be duplicates of previously shared features. If this is the case, simple crush the sticky note and throw it on the ground. Don't spend time describing a feature if it is a duplicate.
    * Once all the features have been shared, group like features into categories. For example the following user stories may be grouped with each other because they both pertain to user authentication.
        * User can log in
        * User can log out
    * Come up with a name for each of the categories. These will be referred to as [EPICs](https://www.yodiz.com/blog/what-is-epic-in-agile-methodology-definition-and-template-of-epic/) and will be a way to organize your features in your project management tool.

## Feature Prioritization and MVP Definition (Decide)

* **Time Limit**
    * 30 minutes
* **Objectives**
    * Define the features that will make up your [**Minimum Viable Product**](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/mvp/#q=~(infinite~false~filters~(tags~(~'mvp))~searchTerm~'~sort~false~sortDirection~'asc~page~1))
* **Instructions**
    * Using masking or painter's tape, place a large line above the sticky notes. The line should start on the far left side and extend across the entire width of sticky notes to the far right side.
    * All sticky notes start out **below the line**
    * The instructor will go through each sticky note one at a time and the team will discuss whether or not this feature should be included in the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) or if the feature should be considered for an extension once the base functionality is built.
    * If the feature should be included in the MVP, move the sticky note above the line. If not, keep the sticky note below the line.
    * If you are unsure about a feature, table the feature and come back to it at the end.
    * Repeat this process until you have gone through all of the sticky notes.
    * Once you are finished, you have your MVP definition.
