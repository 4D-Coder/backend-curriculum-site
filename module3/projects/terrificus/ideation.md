### Project Template

Fill out the following template for your project idea.

```markdown
### [Project Title]

1 sentence that explains the value proposition of the application. How would you explain it to a potential business partner, team member, or investor?

### Problem

### Solution

1-3 sentences describing how your application will solve that problem.

### Target Audience

### Features
* What features will your app include to solve the problem?

### Integrations

* Which APIs will you use?
* Which OAuth integration are you planning to use?
```

### Project Scope

A good project idea should:

* Break down into logical iterations so that you can deliver a strong product on  every checkin
* Be something that real people would want to use to solve a problem
* Have enough *technical* challenge to be worth your time (as opposed to a *content* challenge)
