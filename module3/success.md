## Completion Requirements

In order to graduate from Module 3, students must complete each of the following:

### Final Assessment

Students must meet the expectations laid out in the [final assessment rubric](lessons/assessment) document.

### Independent Work

*[APIcurious](projects/apicurious):* Students are expected to complete APIcurious as an independent project. While this project is not graded, it contains the most important and, for many, the most difficult concepts of the Mod. Students who don't score 3 or higher in all of the categories of the rubric often struggle throughout the remainder of Mod.

*[Self Directed](projects/self_directed_project):* Students should pick projects that will help them in the job hunt and should start gaining comfort taking on new technologies with minimal guidance from instructors. The goal is to get to a point where you are job ready, taking on stories without explicit instructions.

### Group Work

*[Rales Engine](projects/rails_engine)*: Students, as a pair, build an API using advanced `ActiveRecord` techniques.

*[Battleshift](projects/battleshift)*: Students, as a pair, build additional functionality on top of a brownfield code base with tech debt that should be paid down.

### Career Development

The Mod 3 [career development](https://github.com/turingschool/career-development-curriculum/tree/master/module_three) curriculum centers around learning to tell your story and beginning your job hunt.

### Portfolio

Each student will prepare a presentation following the requirements outlined in the [Mod 3 Portfolio](https://github.com/turingschool/portfolios/blob/master/templates/BEM3_template.md) Document.

## Skill Proficiencies

Academic success in B3 means that students demonstrate proficiency and comfort with the concepts below. The expected mastery level can be understood with the following scale:

* **Mastery**: student is able to explain and implement the concept independently or with light reference
* **Functional**: student recognizes when to use the concept and can implement it with the support of documentation and/or a collaborator
* **Familiarity**: student can recognize and describe the concept when needed/appropriate, but is not able to implement the technology/technique

* Students read documentation and implement strategies described *(mastery)*
* Students utilize mentors and other community members to identify and discuss the merits of various implementations *(functional)*
