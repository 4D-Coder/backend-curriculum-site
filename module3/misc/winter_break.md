# Winter Break

It's important that you keep your skills sharp over the winter break, so we'd like you to spend a little bit of time doing some reading, research, and a little bit of coding.


## Reading, 2 hours

* GraphQL
  * what is it
  * how can it be beneficial over RESTful CRUD endpoints
  * build a list of 3 or more pros/cons of having your team implement GraphQL in the upcoming Consultancy project

Put your work in a gist.


## Research, 2 hours

You know the top 4 projects for the upcoming "Consultancy" group project, but you don't know (yet) which team you'll be on.

Over break, revisit [this page](https://backend.turing.io/module3/projects/consultancy/ideation) which outlines several places to read about available APIs, and come up with TWO different APIs that you think could be useful/helpful in each of the project ideas. You will discuss these APIs as a team on the first day back in January.

Put your work in a gist.


## Coding, 16 hours

OAuth is an important skill to understand and implement.

Build a VERY simple Rails app (not an `--api`), and implement OmniAuth to authenticate a user to do one of the following tasks:

Using GitHub, show a user a list of all of their repos which are NOT a forked repo, and retrieve a commit count for each repo.
