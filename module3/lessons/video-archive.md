# Video Archive of recorded remote classes

We believe very strongly in "perspective" and seeing/hearing many teachers sharing a class over time. We are doing our best to record classes for students to review so that they may hear slightly different viewpoints, hear students ask different kinds of questions during the class, listen to different discussions, and so on.


## This list may not be complete

We'll do our best to add videos to this list over time.
