## Consuming an API

### Learning Goals

By the end of this class, a student will be able to:

* Use BDD to build complex features
* Set up and configure Faraday for use with a Rails application.
* Use Faraday to connect to and retrieve information from third party external
APIs.
* Parse the information retrieved from a third party API.
* Create models to contain and model the information returned from an external
API.

### Summary

What we are going to be working on today is creating an app that reaches out
and consumes data from an external API, and then displays and formats that
data on a web page. The API we will be using is the ProPublica API, and we will
be using it to grab a list of Representatives from Congress.


We will accomplish that by starting with a user story.


```
As a user
When I visit "/"
And I select "Colorado" from the dropdown
And I click on "Locate Members from the House"
Then my path should be "/search" with "state=CO" in the parameters
And I should see a message "7 Results"
And I should see a list of 7 the members of the house for Colorado
And they should be ordered by seniority from most to least
And I should see a name, role, party, and district for each member
```

As you can see, it lines out all that we will do. Let's get started.


### Setup

We start by spinning up our rails app. We are going to call it House Salad.

Because we're getting information about the House of Representatives and we're
gonna toss it around. Kind of.

```sh
$ rails new house-salad -T -d postgresql
$ cd house-salad
```

Great, now we should get in the gems we want. Add this to your `Gemfile`.

```
gem 'faraday'
gem 'bootstrap-sass'

group :development, :test do
  gem 'pry'
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'capybara'
end
```

Now, you'll want to bundle to install the gems you've added, install rspec,
and create your databases.

```sh
$ bundle
$ rails g rspec:install
$ rails db:create
$ rails db:migrate
```

Yes, we haven't created any migrations, but running rails db:migrate
will generate the `schema.rb` so we don't get an error when we start running
tests.

### Testing, All Day, Every Day

So we've got the basic setup.

Let's create our first test files.

```sh
$ mkdir spec/features/
$ touch spec/features/user_can_search_by_state_spec.rb
```

Now let's open up that file and translate our user story into a test.

```
require 'rails_helper'


feature "user can search for house members" do

  scenario "user submits valid state name" do
    # As a user
    # When I visit "/"
    visit '/'

    select "Colorado", from: :state
    # And I select "Colorado" from the dropdown
    click_on "Locate Members of the House"
    # And I click on "Locate Members from the House"
    expect(current_path).to eq(search_path)
    # Then my path should be "/search" with "state=CO" in the parameters
    expect(page).to have_content("7 Results")
    # And I should see a message "7 Results"
    expect(page).to have_css(".member", count: 7)
    # And I should see a list of 7 the members of the house for Colorado

    within(first(".member")) do
      expect(page).to have_css(".name")
      expect(page).to have_css(".role")
      expect(page).to have_css(".party")
      expect(page).to have_css(".district")
    end
    # And they should be ordered by seniority from most to least
    # And I should see a name, role, party, and district for each member

  end
end
```

This test should look pretty straightforward.

And so we run our tests. We should get an error concerning our routes.

Let's edit our `routes.rb` and add a root route that goes to the index action
in a welcome controller.

```
  root "welcome#index"
```

Running the test again, it's not going to be happy that we don't have a
welcome controller. Let's make one.

```
$ rails g controller welcome
```

Once we do that, let's add the index action straight away.

```
class WelcomeController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end
end
```

Now it's going to complain about not finding the template, so we have some
work to do.

First step, we are going to rename `app/assets/stylesheets.css` to
`app/assets/stylesheets.scss` and we are going to delete its contents to add
this:

```
@import "bootstrap-sprockets";
@import "bootstrap";

.search-field { margin-top: 7px;}
```

Now, if we remember the user story, the application is expecting us to select
Colorado out of a drop box. We can safely imply that we need to have all of
the other states in this drop box as well. We don't want this to go in the
view, so we can take advantage of the application helper.

Add this to `app/helpers/application_helper.rb`

```
def us_states
    [
      ['Alabama', 'AL'],
      ['Alaska', 'AK'],
      ['Arizona', 'AZ'],
      ['Arkansas', 'AR'],
      ['California', 'CA'],
      ['Colorado', 'CO'],
      ['Connecticut', 'CT'],
      ['Delaware', 'DE'],
      ['District of Columbia', 'DC'],
      ['Florida', 'FL'],
      ['Georgia', 'GA'],
      ['Hawaii', 'HI'],
      ['Idaho', 'ID'],
      ['Illinois', 'IL'],
      ['Indiana', 'IN'],
      ['Iowa', 'IA'],
      ['Kansas', 'KS'],
      ['Kentucky', 'KY'],
      ['Louisiana', 'LA'],
      ['Maine', 'ME'],
      ['Maryland', 'MD'],
      ['Massachusetts', 'MA'],
      ['Michigan', 'MI'],
      ['Minnesota', 'MN'],
      ['Mississippi', 'MS'],
      ['Missouri', 'MO'],
      ['Montana', 'MT'],
      ['Nebraska', 'NE'],
      ['Nevada', 'NV'],
      ['New Hampshire', 'NH'],
      ['New Jersey', 'NJ'],
      ['New Mexico', 'NM'],
      ['New York', 'NY'],
      ['North Carolina', 'NC'],
      ['North Dakota', 'ND'],
      ['Ohio', 'OH'],
      ['Oklahoma', 'OK'],
      ['Oregon', 'OR'],
      ['Pennsylvania', 'PA'],
      ['Puerto Rico', 'PR'],
      ['Rhode Island', 'RI'],
      ['South Carolina', 'SC'],
      ['South Dakota', 'SD'],
      ['Tennessee', 'TN'],
      ['Texas', 'TX'],
      ['Utah', 'UT'],
      ['Vermont', 'VT'],
      ['Virginia', 'VA'],
      ['Washington', 'WA'],
      ['West Virginia', 'WV'],
      ['Wisconsin', 'WI'],
      ['Wyoming', 'WY']
    ]
end
```

That gives us a nice array of arrays of the states and their abbreviations.

Because we placed this in the application_helper.rb file, we now have access
to `us_states` anywhere in our views. (Quiz: Where isn't this available?)

Now that we have this, we are going to edit our
app/views/layouts/application.html.erb.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>HouseSalad</title>
    <%= csrf_meta_tags %>

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag    'application', media: 'all' %>
    <%= javascript_include_tag 'application' %>
  </head>

  <body>
    <nav class="navbar navbar-default" role="navigation">
      <div class="navbar-header">
        <button class="navbar-toggle" data-target="#bs-example-navbar-collapse-1" data-toggle="collapse" type="button">
          <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
          <span class="icon-bar"></span>
          <span class="icon-bar"></span>
          <span class="icon-bar"></span>
        </button>
        <%= link_to "HouseSalad", root_path, class: "navbar-brand" %>
      </div>
      <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="bs-example-navbar-collapse-1">
        <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
          <%= form_tag :search, method: :get, class: "form-inline" do %>
            <div class="form-group search-field">
              <%= select_tag :state, options_for_select(us_states) %>
              <%= submit_tag "Locate Members of the House", class: "btn btn-primary" %>
            </div>
          <% end %>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </nav>

    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

The idea is that the navigation is going to be in this nav bar which will
persist across all of the views, so after viewing the Representatives
of a single state, we will be able to immediately go to another state.

So now we need to run our test once again. And it's going to freak out. Our
form wont be happy about where we are trying to send information. So we are
going to have to add a route.

```
get "/search", to: "search#index"
```

And of course, we need to generate a controller and add to it an index action

```
# app/controllers/search_controller.rb
class SearchController < ApplicationController
  def index
  end
end

```

When we run the tests now, we're not getting the results on the page we are
expecting.

It is only seeing our navbar, so let's first get ourselves a search/index view.

```
# app/views/search/index.html.erb

<%= @members.count %> Results
<% @members.each do |member| %>
<ul class="member">
  <li class="name"><%= member.name %></li>
  <li class="role"><%= member.role %></li>
  <li class="party"><%= member.party %></li>
  <li class="district"><%= member.district %></li>
</ul>
<% end %>


```

Now we have everything set up except we aren't creating a @members array
to send to our view.

We need to do some work in our search controller. Since we are working with
the index action, in this action we should contact the API, and get the
information we are looking for.

The following isn't going to be pretty, but we will be refactoring later.

Let's put this in our index action.

```
def index
  state = params[:state]
  @conn = Faraday.new(url: "https://api.propublica.org") do |faraday|
    faraday.headers["X-API-KEY"] = "S9JON3ruNOI6XiyymcnZ7gtsjnToPxuXyT0bgeaX"
    faraday.adapter Faraday.default_adapter
  end

  response = @conn.get("/congress/v1/members/house/#{state}/current.json")

  @members = JSON.parse(response.body, symbolize_names: true)[:results]
end
```

This is how we set up the Faraday gem to talk and grab information from an
external API. We set up an instance variable to hold the connection
information, we tell it the name of the server, and our API Key, which
is our password to be able to access the API. And then we use the get method
on the connection and pass it the end point we want to access. We store that
in the response local variable, and then we parse it.

At this point, we are sending the parsed result of the response to the view.
The view happily accepts this, but if we run the test, we can see that it's not
happy.

What is the class of `@members` right here? It's an array of hashes. The view
is iterating through the array, and hashes don't have methods like name, and
district and so forth. We could change what the view wants, but lets do a bit
of dream driven development here and say that our intent is that we have an
array of member objects sent to the view and not an array of hashes. That would be gross. You don't want to be gross, do you?

So before we can send it to the view, we need to do some conversion.

We need a member class so let's create a member class.

```
# app/models/member.rb

class Member
  attr_reader :name,
              :role,
              :party,
              :district,
              :seniority

  def initialize(attributes = {})
    @name       = attributes[:name]
    @role       = attributes[:role]
    @party      = attributes[:party]
    @district   = attributes[:district]
    @seniority  = attributes[:seniority].to_i
  end
end
```

And then finally, we set up the creation of members in our controller.

```
# app/controllers/search_controller.rb

def index
...
  results = JSON.parse(response.body, symbolize_names: true)[:results]

  @members  = results.map do |result|
     Member.new(result)
  end
end
```

### Figaro

Now it's time to add Figaro.

Why do we need Figaro?

What does it do?

First thing we do, is we add figaro to our Gemfile, and then we run

```sh
$ bundle exec figaro install
```

This will create an application.yml in the config directory. That's where we
keep our secrets. It also automatically adds it to our project .gitignore
so it doesn't get committed and then uploaded to GitHub.

In our application.yml file we just add in our key like this:

```
propublica_key: "adkljasd987987ad987"
```

And in our code, we just refer to it like this:

```
ENV["propublica_key"]
```

Please note that all values will be converted to strings.

We can now go to our search_controller.rb file and replace our reference to
the pro publica key with the environment variable.

Note how this will change your documentation. Also how this will change
how you interact with teammates if keys change. How do you think you'll share
keys across your team?


### Checks for Understanding

* What does Faraday do?
* What is an API Key?
* What is a connection?
* What are headers?
* What don't you like about this code?
* Is our feature test enough?
* What are we missing?
* Do you like the index action in the search controller?
* How would you start to refactor this?

Our next step is to refactor this.
