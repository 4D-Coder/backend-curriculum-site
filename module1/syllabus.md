## Overview

In Module 1, students will learn to use Ruby and object-oriented programming to build software. They will develop skills to write automated tests, pseudocode, write implementation code, and refactor code to meet Ruby conventions. Through several large group projects and regular pairing exercises, students will learn skills and procedures for effectively collaborating and pairing with other developers.

## Projects

Students will be given a weekly project that will require them to apply new concepts from class and build on existing knowledge. Students will have a total of 5 projects in Module 1:

* Week 1 project (independent) - Begin Monday week 1, due Friday week 1.
* Week 2 project (independent) - Begin Friday week 1, due Thursday week 2.
* Week 3 project (paired) - Begin Friday week 2, due Thursday week 3.
* Week 4 project (independent) - Begin Friday week 3, due Thursday week 4.
* Final Project (paired) - Begin Friday week 4, due Wednesday week 6.

Projects will be assessed based on [This Rubric](./project_rubric). Students will have an in-person evaluation with an Instructor and will have access to their project scores in the [Ruby Submissions Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-submissions)

## Independent Challenges

Students will be given a timed code challenge to be completed independently, meaning the student cannot seek help from other students, mentors, etc. This challenge is open note, open internet.

In order to practice for the Final Independent Assessment in week 6, students will be given a practice Independent Challenge most weeks. They will be submitted using a Github Pull request, and instructors will give feedback in the form of comments on the Pull Request. These are not formal assessments, but an opportunity for the student to practice their problem solving skills and receive feedback from instructors.

Students can find examples of Independent Challenges [here](./exercises)

The Final Independent Challenge in week 6 will be graded using [This Rubric](./independent_rubric)

## Paired Assessments

Students will pair with an Instructor on a 45 minute code challenge. The instructor may ask the student questions to probe into their process and strategy and can also answer any questions the student may have.

In order to practice for the Final Paired Assessment in week 6, students will participate in the Mid Module Paired Assessment in week 4.

Students can find examples of Paired Assessment challenges [here](./exercises)

The Final Paired Assessment will be graded using [This Rubric](./paired_rubric)

## Scores

Projects, Paired Assessments, and Independent Assessments will be scored on a 4 point scale:

1. Well Below Expectations
2. Below Expectations
3. Meets Expectations
4. Well Above expectations

Scores reflect the instructor's expectations for the student’s progress at that moment in time, not the expectations for the end of the mod. Assessments will be broken into iterations. A student is expected to complete the project or assessment through iteration 3.

## Written CFU (Check for Understanding)

Students will receive a weekly CFU (check for understanding). This CFU will cover the material up to that week. It is to be completed independently, and is closed note, closed internet. Instructors will collect the CFUs, but they will not be graded. Review of the CFU will usually take place on Fridays as a class.

## Ruby Exercises
[Link to Repo](https://github.com/turingschool/ruby-exercises)

These exercises are to be used by students to practice the material covered in module 1. While the projects require synthesizing many concepts, the Ruby Exercises are meant to practice a concept in isolation. Successful students will reinforce their skills through both projects and exercises. During paired projects, students will explain in their DTR (Define the Relationship) how they will make time to work on their exercises. Exercises will not be assigned or graded, however instructors will provide a weekly list of suggested exercises to practice the material.

## Support

**One-on-Ones**: Students can request to meet with an instructor to talk about non-technical topics. This can include a student’s progress, stress management, suggestions for improvement, etc. This conversation should not involve laptops, coding, whiteboarding, etc. These will be guaranteed if requested.

**Project Check Ins**: Students can request an instructor review their progress on the project. These will be guaranteed once per project if requested.

**Instructor Pairing**: Students can request paired work time with an instructor. These are not guaranteed and are at the individual instructor’s discretion.

## Lightning Talks

Each student will give a 5 minute presentation on a topic of their choosing. This topic does not have to be technical, but must be approved by instructors.

## Portfolios

Students must complete a Portfolio, and participate in a Portfolio Review. Instructions for the Portfolio can be found [here](./portfolios)

## Slack

Instructors will use the cohort Slack channel as the primary means of communication with students.

When sending a direct message (dm), students must DM ALL instructors. Exceptions are when a DM only applies to one instructor, for instance scheduling a one-on-one.

## Attendance

Attendance is required at 90% or above to pass Module 1.

Attendance will be counted at all scheduled activities from 9:00 am to 4:00 pm not listed as "Project Work Time". Per the Student Course Catalog, tardiness will be counted as absence.
