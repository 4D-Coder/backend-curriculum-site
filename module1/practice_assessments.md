## Practice Paired Assessment

There are two paired assessments in Mod 1:
* **Mid Mod Assessment** (Week 3)
* **Instructor Final Paired Assessment** (Week 5/6).

Instructions:
* You will be given pre-work to complete before arriving at the assessment (Iterations 1 and 2).
* During the assessment, you will be given an additional coding challenge that builds upon your existing code (Iteration 3).
* You will be graded based on how much of Iteration 3 you are able to complete successfully.

Example Paired Assessment:
* [Pets and Customers](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers): the entire repository
  * [Pre-work](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers/blob/master/prework.md)
  * Option 1: [Groomer](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers/blob/master/groomer.md)
  * Option 2: [Day Care](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers/blob/master/day_care.md)
  * Option 3: [Veterinary Clinic](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/pets_and_customers/blob/master/veterinary_clinic.md)

## Practice Independent Challenges

**Week 2**

The week 2 challenge is an intro to Object Oriented Programming. It will require students to build two classes that interact, as well as use an enumerable.

Example: [Potluck](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/potluck)

**Week 3**

The week 3 challenge will require students to build three classes that interact. It will also involve a more complex enumeration problem that can't be solved with a single enumerable. Students will also need to access a Hash.

Example: [World Cup](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/world_cup)

**Week 4**

The week 4 challenge will involve three classes with only partial specifications. Students must think algorithmically to build an Object Oriented solution that solves the problem. Students will also be required to build a hash.

Examples:
[Boat Rental](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/boat_rental) |
[Colorado Lottery](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/colorado_lottery_2003)

**Weeks 5 and 6**

The week 5 and 6 challenges are a test of a student's knowledge of OOP and Ruby mechanics. They will involve two or three classes that interact, iterating over a hash, and several methods that can't be built with a single enumerable.

The week 5 challenge will be a practice for the final in week 6.

Examples:
[Reunion](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/reunion) |
[Museo](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/museo)
