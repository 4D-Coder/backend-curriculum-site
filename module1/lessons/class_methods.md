### Slides available [here.](../slides/class_methods)

## Learning Goals

*  Explain the syntactic difference between class and instance methods
*  Explain when a developer might use a class method
*  Use a class method to create an instance

## Structure
5 min - Warm Up
10 min - Classes as we know them
10 min - Class vs Instance Methods
5 min - Break
10 min - Use of Class Methods
10 min - Independent Practice
5 min - Wrap Up

## Vocabulary
* Instance Method
* Class Method
* Ruby Object

## Warm Up
```ruby
> sam = User.new("Sam")
# => #<User:0x007f94e3ab6218 @name="Sam">
> sam.say_hello("Jay")
# => "Hello, Jay!"
```

* What do we call the method `#say_hello` on? What do we call the method `::new` on?
* In the method list in the Ruby docs page for Array, what is the difference between methods with a `#` prefix and those with a `::` prefix?

## Classes as we Know Them

**Turn & Talk**
Turn to a partner and define what a class is. Explain how you use one and why. Try to incorporate as much of the technical language as you can.

#### Uses for Classes
* Factories for instances of a thing
* Hold blueprints.
    * Instance Variables (State)
    * Methods (Behavior)

#### Classes are Objects Too
Imagine you are building out a collection of users of your program.

```
# user.rb

class User

end


# pry
require "./user"

User
=> User

User.object_id
=> 70334065129900

users = User
=> User

users.object_id
=> 70334065129900

tanya = User.new
tanya.object_id
=> 70334063539260
```

## Class Methods
Okay, so classes are objects too. But what does this mean in practice? How do you use a Class object?

### Class Methods vs Instance Methods
```ruby
# user.rb

class User

  def self.description
    "I'm the User class! I don't have a name."
  end

  def self.print_self
    puts self
  end

  def initialize(name)
    @name = name
  end

  def description
    "I'm a User! My name is #{@name}"
  end

  def print_self
    puts self
  end

end

# pry
reqiure "./user.rb"

User.description
=> "I'm the User class! I don't have a name."

tanya = User.new("Tanya")
tanya.description
=> "I'm a User! My name is #{@name}"
```

** break **

**Turn & Talk**
How do you define a class method? How do you call a class method?

### Use of Class Methods
What if we are getting user data from disparate sources. Maybe some users are being ported in though a CSV of user data, others are coming in as JSON (think hash format), others are being created by signing up from an account and therefore our program is creating users directly.


```ruby
# user.rb

class User

  def self.load_from_hash(user_info)
  	name = user_info["name"]
  	email = user_info["email"]
  	address = user_info["address"]
	  User.new(name, email, address)
  end

  def self.load_from_csv(user_info)
  	name = user_info[:name]
  	email = user_info[:email]
  	address = user_info[:address]
	  User.new(name, email, address)
  end

  def initialize(name, email, address)
    @name = name
    @email = email
    @address = address
  end

end

# pry
reqiure "./user.rb"

users = []

users << User.load_from_hash({"name" => "Ariana", "email" => "ariana@email.com", "address" => "1874 Market St, Denver CO 80203"})

CSV.foreach('./users.csv', headers: true, header_converters: :symbol) do |row|
   users << User.load_from_csv(row)
end

users << User.new("Tanya","tanya@email.com", "8293 Colorado Blvd, Denver, CO 89374")

puts users

```

### Independent Practice
Suppose you are collecting Jokes for a joke telling application. Create a Joke class so that you can load information via .new, .from_hash, & .from_csv. Expect jokes to have an id, a question, and an answer as their state.


## Wrap Up
* What is the syntactic difference between class methods & instance methods?
* Why might you use a class method instead of an instance method?
