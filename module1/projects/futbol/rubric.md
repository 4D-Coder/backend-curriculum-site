| Category | **4: Exceptional** | **3: Passing** | **2: Passing with Concern** | **1: Failing** |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ------------------------- | ------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| **Functionality** | Completes all iterations | Completes all functionality in iterations 1 through 5. | Does not complete one of the following iterations: 2, 3, 4, 5 | Does not complete two or more of the following: iterations 1, 2, 3, 4, 5|
| **Object Oriented Programming** | Students have implemented both inheritance and at least one module in a logical manner.  Students can speak as to how/why inheritance and modules made sense for the given implementations, why they improve the organization of the code, and the distinction between the two. | Students have implemented either inheritance or at least one module in a logical manner.  Students can speak as to how/why inheritance or modules made sense for the given implementation, and why it improves the organization of their code.  No class is over 150 lines long. | Students can clearly identify the responsibility of each class that they created and the methods that they wrote. Students are able to describe why they have organized their code in the way they did. No class is over 200 lines long. | Students have difficulty explaining the reason they have organized their code in the way that they did. They may have few files that seem to be doing the vast majority of the work in the project, and have not drawn clear lines between the responsibilities of different classes they have created. |
| **Test Driven Development** | Mocks and/or stubs are used appropriately to ensure two or more of the following: testing is more robust (i.e., testing methods that might not otherwise be tested due to factors like randomness or user input), testing is more efficient (i.e., not reading a full CSV file every time you call a method for a test), or that classes can be tested without relying on functionality from other classes. Students are able to speak as to how mocks and/or stubs are fulfilling the above conditions. Spec harness runs in 5 seconds or less.  | Mocks and/or stubs are used appropriately to ensure one of the following: testing is more robust (i.e., testing methods that might not otherwise be tested due to factors like randomness or user input), testing is more efficient (i.e., not reading a full CSV file every time you call a method for a test), or that classes can be tested without relying on functionality from other classes. Students are able to speak as to how mocks and/or stubs are fulfilling the above conditions. | Test coverage is above 90%. Students may not be able to identify unit or integration tests. Git history may demonstrate that students are writing implementation code and then writing tests. | Test coverage is below 90%. |
| **Version Control** | Students document and implement a code review process throughout the project whereby comments on pull requests are addressed before PRs are merged. | Students contributed roughly equally to the project in terms of number of commits and lines of code. Commits are made in small chunks of functionality. Students used pull requests as a collaboration tool by reviewing each otherâ€™s PRs, making comments, and never merging their own PRs. | Students did not contribute equally to the project in terms of number of commits or lines of code. Commits include multiple pieces of functionality. Pull requests present but do not include comments or were merged by their author. | Code is hosted on Github, but has fewer than 30 commits or has less than 5 pull requests|
