## Background
Battleship is a classic board game where players place one or more ships on a grid board, and then take turns trying to "sink" the other player's ships by guessing their coordinates. The game ends when one player's ships are all hit and "sunk".

## Learning Goals

* Utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Practice algorithmic thinking
* Create an Object-Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
* Work in a pair, using Pull Requests to collaborate
