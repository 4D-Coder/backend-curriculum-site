## Iteration 4

Complete one or more of the following extensions:

* When starting the game, a player should be able to indicate a size for the board, and what ships they will play with.

* Add some 'intelligence' to your computer so that it is not making shots at random, but making an 'educated' guess at the best shot location.

* Make it a two player game.

* Make your game playable through a web browser. You may find [This Tutorial](/module1/projects/http_tutorial) helpful.
