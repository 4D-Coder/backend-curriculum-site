## Learning Goals / Areas of Focus

* Proficiently use TDD to drive development
* Practice breaking a program into logical components
* Practice implementing a useable REPL interface
* Apply previously learned Enumerable techniques in a real context

### Expectations

Please complete the following iterations in order, fully completing one iteration before moving on to the next.

* [Iteration 1](./iteration_1)
* [Iteration 2](./iteration_2)
* [Iteration 3](./iteration_3)
* [Iteration 4](./iteration_4)
