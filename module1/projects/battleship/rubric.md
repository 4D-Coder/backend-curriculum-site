<br> | **4: Well Above Expectations** | **3: Meets Expectations** | **2: Below Expectations** | **1: Well Below Expectations**
-- | --- | --- | --- | ---
**Functionality** | 2 of the features in Iteration 4 are complete | All of the functionality in Iteration 3 is complete | Some of the functionality in Iteration 3 is not complete | Game cannot execute ship placement or iteration 2 is not complete |
**Object Oriented Programming** | Project includes at least one additional class that does no command line input or output and acts as a crucial piece in the function of the program | Very little code is not contained within a class. The correct number of Board, Cell, and Ship objects are created. | Project includes at least one additional class not outlined in the spec. Ship, Cell, or Board objects may be created unnecessarily. Code that is crucial to the setup, play, or end of a game is not contained in a class | Project does not include a class not outlined in the spec or does not use Ship, Cell, or Board objects to accomplish the task |
**Test Driven Development** | Methods are structured so that command line input/output is segregated, allowing for most methods to be tested. All methods that do not require command line input/output are tested. | Every method outlined in iterations 1 and 2 includes tests. No more than 2 tests fail to accurately verify expected behavior. | Every method from iteration 1 or 2 does not include a test. More than 2 tests fail to accurately verify expected behavior. | Half the methods of either the Ship, Cell, or Board class are not tested or have tests that do not accurately verify expected behavior |
**Version Control** | Project includes at least 10 pull requests that include helpful comments from both partners and were not merged by the author | Project includes at least 10 pull requests and 30 commits | Project includes at least 5 pull requests and 20 commits | Project has 5 or fewer pull requests or less than 20 commits |
