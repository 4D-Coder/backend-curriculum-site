For the project eval, you should prepare a 10 minute video presentation that clearly demonstrates the presentation points listed below. To create your video presentation, we suggest hopping on a zoom call with your partner, sharing your screen, and recording your meeting as you go through the presentation points. Then, upload that video to either your Google Drive or YouTube. When submitting, the survey form will ask for your presentation video link.

The technical presentation portion is outlined below with what points should be covered. If you have questions about the presentation, please let an instructor know before the time it's due.


## Presentation points:

[ ] Demonstration of functional completeness
 * Run your runner file, and demonstrate how the game is played in the terminal. If you've considered edge cases, make sure you demonstrate that functionality in your demo.

[ ] Technical quality and organization of the code
 * At a high level (not line by line), describe how you broke out this game. What classes did you create? What is the responsibility of each class? Why did you choose to design your code in this way?
 * Is there a design decision that you made that you're particularly proud of?

[ ] Identifying code that should be refactored and how it would be refactored
 * Identify a piece of code that you'd like to refactor. How would you update that code?
 * Are there any parts of your code that you're unsure/hesitant about? Why?

[ ] Discussion of test coverage
 * Show examples of a unit and an integration test that you wrote.
 * Run your test suite and open coverage report (if you were able to implement simplecov)

[ ] Discussion of Pairing/version control
 * How did you all work together? Did you use a particular pairing technique?
 * Walk us through your GitHub insights. How many pull requests did you make? How many commits did you make?
 * Can you identify a PR that was made that demonstrates good commenting/partner review workflow?
