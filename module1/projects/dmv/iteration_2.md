title: Iteration 2 - Adding Features and Creating Objects from Data Sources
---

_[Back to The DMV Home](./index)_

Now that we have our new `Service` class, let's add some functionality to our `Facility` class so a specific DMV facility can administer services to visitors.
  * Services that can be performed:
    * Register a vehicle
    * Administer a road test
    * Administer a written test
    * Renew a driver's license

Use the following interaction pattern to help build this functionality:

```ruby
coming soon...
```

With the provided data set (Washington State EV Vehicle Registration data), create `Vehicle` objects using your `Vehicle` class.

Use the following interaction pattern to guide your build:
```ruby
coming soon...
```

Let's also do a little analysis of this data to see what kinds of vehicles are being registered.
  * Most popular make/model registered
  * Count of registered vehicle for a model year
  * County with most registered vehicles

Use the following interaction pattern as a guide:
```ruby
coming soon...
```
