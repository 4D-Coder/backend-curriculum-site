## Background
Recently, the Department of Motor Vehicles hired a software developer to help build a new program to help manage the services they offer and process some data. Unfortunately, they didn't hire a Turing grad and so the job is incomplete. Thankfully, you're here to help carry this project through to the end.

## Learning Goals

* Utilize Test-Driven Development (TDD)
* Host code on Github and use Pull Requests
* Create an Object-Oriented solution to a problem without being given full specifications
* Work with an existing codebase
* Manipulate data from external sources

## Overview

In this project you'll use Ruby to build out some functionality for The Department of Motor Vehicles. More detail can be found in the pages below:
