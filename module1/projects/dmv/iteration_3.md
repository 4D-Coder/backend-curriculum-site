title: Iteration 3 - Creating Objects from Multiple Data Sets and Analyzing Our Data

Let's do that again with different data! Create DMV `Facility` objects from Oregon State DMV Facility data

Use the following interaction pattern to guide your build:
```ruby

Cool! Now you can handle creating `Facility` objects from one data source. But what about another state? The fun things about data sources is that everyone has their own rules. Refactor your code to allow for the creation of `Facility` objects from another data source. You should be able to create objects from ALL provided data sources. This means that by changing your code to work for the New York dataset, it should also continue to work for the Oregon dataset. We **STRONGLY** recommend doing one at a time. Make sure all your past tests for the previous dataset still pass when you're done adding code for your new dataset.
