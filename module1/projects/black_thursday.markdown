Black Thursday
===============

A business is only as smart as its data. Let's build a system to manage our data and execute business intelligence queries against the data from a typical e-commerce business.

Project Overview
-----------------

### Learning Goals

*   Use tests to drive both the design and implementation of code
*   Decompose a large application into components
*   Design a solution that is functional, readable, maintainable, and testable
*   Learn an agile approach to building software

### Getting Started

1.  One team member forks the repository [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/black_thursday) and adds the other(s) as collaborators.
1.  Everyone on the team clones the repository
1.  Setup [SimpleCov](https://github.com/colszowka/simplecov) to monitor test coverage along the way
1.  Setup [Rubocop](https://atom.io/packages/linter-rubocop)
1.  Setup [Hound CI](https://houndci.com/)
1.  Create a Rakefile

#### Special Notes

This project will require you to be running version 2.3.x of Ruby. This will get you used to working in an older version of Ruby and you will learn how to work with different versions of Rubies using rbenv.

Documentation for rbenv can be found [here](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv/blob/master/README.md)

### Spec Harness

This project will be assessed with the help of a [spec harness](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness). The `README.md` file includes instructions for setup and usage. Note that the spec harness **is not** a replacement for your own test suite.

Spec harness `README.md` [here](https://github.com/turingschool/black_thursday_spec_harness)

### Key Concepts

From a technical perspective, this project will emphasize:

*   File I/O
*   Database Operations (CRUD)
*   Encapsulating Responsibilities
*   Light data / analytics

### Project Iterations and Base Expectations

Because the requirements for this project are lengthy and complex, we've broken
them into Iterations in their own files. Your project *must* implement iterations 0 through 3 and either 4 or 5.

*   [Iteration 0](black_thursday_iterations/iteration_0) - Merchants & Items
*   [Iteration 1](black_thursday_iterations/iteration_1) - Beginning Relationships and Business Intelligence
*   [Iteration 2](black_thursday_iterations/iteration_2) - Basic Invoices
*   [Iteration 3](black_thursday_iterations/iteration_3) - Item Sales
*   [Iteration 4](black_thursday_iterations/iteration_4) - Merchant Analytics
*   [Iteration 5](black_thursday_iterations/iteration_5) - Customer Analytics


## Evaluation Rubric

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

* 4: Above expectations
* 3: Meets expectations
* 2: Below expectations
* 1: Well-below expectations

**Expectations:**

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

- [ ] Applies appropriate attribute encapsulation  
- [ ] Developer creates instance and local variables appropriately
- [ ] Naming follows convention (is idiomatic)
- [ ] Ruby methods used are logical and readable  
- [ ] Developer implements best-choice enumerable methods
- [ ] Code is indented properly
- [ ] Code does not exceed 80 characters per line
- [ ] A directory/file structure provides basic organization via lib/ and/or /test  
- [ ] Rubocop shows five or fewer complaints

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

- [ ] Code is effectively broken into methods & classes
- [ ] Developer writes methods less than 7 lines
- [ ] No more than 3 methods break the principle of SRP

### 3. Test-Driven Development

- [ ] Each method is tested  
- [ ] Functionality is accurately covered
- [ ] Tests implement Ruby syntax & style   
- [ ] Balances unit and integration tests
- [ ] Evidence of edge cases testing
- [ ] Test Coverage metrics are present (SimpleCov)
- [ ] A test RakeTask is implemented

### 4. Functionality

- [ ] Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5

### 5. Version Control

- [ ] Developers commit at a pace of at least 1 commit per hour
- [ ] Developers implements branching and PRs
- [ ] Developer resolves Hound CI complaints on PRs
- [ ] Commit history shows developers contributed evenly
- [ ] The final submitted version is merged into master

<!-- Evaluation Rubric
------------------

The project will be assessed with the following guidelines:

### 1. Ruby Syntax & Style

*   4:  Application demonstrates excellent knowledge of Ruby syntax, style, and refactoring
*   3:  Application shows strong effort towards organization, content, and refactoring
*   2:  Application runs but the code has long methods, unnecessary or poorly named variables, and needs significant refactoring
*   1:  Application generates syntax error or crashes during execution

### 2. Breaking Logic into Components

*   4: Application is expertly divided into logical components each with a clear, single responsibility
*   3: Application effectively breaks logical components apart but breaks the principle of SRP
*   2: Application shows some effort to break logic into components, but the divisions are inconsistent or unclear
*   1: Application logic shows poor decomposition with too much logic mashed together

### 3. Test-Driven Development

*   4: Application is broken into components which are well tested in both isolation and integration using appropriate data
*   3: Application is well tested but does not balance isolation and integration tests, using only the data necessary to test the functionality
*   2: Application makes some use of tests, but the coverage is insufficient
*   1: Application does not demonstrate strong use of TDD

### 4. Functional Expectations

*   4: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, (4 or 5), and features of your own design
*   3: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, 3, and either 4 or 5
*   2: Application implements iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3
*   1: Application does not fully implement iterations 0, 1, 2, and 3

### 5. Code Sanitation

The output from `rake sanitation:all` shows...

*   4: Zero complaints
*   3: Five or fewer complaints
*   2: Six to ten complaints
*   1: More than ten complaints  

### 6. Version Control  
<!--  (doesn't apply to all projects, but a good spot for project-specific rubric requirements) -->  
<!-- * 4: Student demonstrates strong git workflow, commits frequently to document progress, uses commits to identify added functionality, and utilizes pull requests for communication and feedback  
* 3: Student utilizes git workflow essentials, committing frequently to document progress
* 2: Student adds and commits infrequently and pushes project to GitHub  
* 1: Student makes an initial commit and pushes project to GitHub   -->
