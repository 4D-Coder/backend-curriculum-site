## Retrospective

The group should perform a retrospective (often just called "retro"). There are many many ways to do a project retro. A quick Google search will yield dozens of links to resources about how, why, when, etc. as well as tools you can use to facilitate a retro.

For this iteration, research how to run a retro. Collectively decide on a method and then do it!

If your team gets to this iteration and performs a retro, you should discuss it during your project presentation. Here are some ideas of ways you can talk about it during the eval:
* What formats did the group consider?
* Why did you choose the format you did?
* Did this retro feel effective? What might you try differently the next time you run a group retro?
* Summarize the outcome of the retro.
