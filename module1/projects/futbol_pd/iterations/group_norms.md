title: Establishing Group Norms and Project Design

## Group Norms
* Git Workflow Expectations
* Project Organization
* Communication and Collaboration

## Project Planning and Design
There are a few things to consider when deciding how you want to organization your code:

* What classes do you need?
  * Classes should be compact.
  * Classes should have a single responsibility - you should be able to describe what a class is responsible for in one sentence.
* Use the tools we have learned recently when thinking about reorganization - Modules, Inheritance, and Plain Old Ruby Objects (POROs).
* What makes the most sense for how to break this out in to pieces that individuals or pairs can work on. Odds are, you won't be mob programming the entire project.
* How will you determine when something is "good enough" to move on to the next thing (potential to refactor later)?
